# Installing

## Step 1. Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/django-app
Cloning into 'django-app'...
...
Resolving deltas: 100% (1843/1843), done.
```

Then navigate into the repository (`cd django-app`).

## Step 2. Create virtual enviroment

Next, create a virtual environment for Django to run in:

```sh
$ python -m venv env
```

Then activate the environment:

```sh
$ source env/bin/activate
```

## Step 3: Install requirements

The script contains a `requirements.txt` file in the root of the repository, which makes it easy for you to run a command to run all the required dependencies:

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
Collecting django==3.0.7 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
  ...
```

That should show you the progress of the installation of all the python dependencies for the project.
