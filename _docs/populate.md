# 2. Populate Database

The Django app comes with built-in support to download all the data from the DHRI Curriculum, in a number of different ways. The most straight-forward way is what follows.

## Step 1. Set up database structure

First, set up the database by running two commands from Django's built-in management script:

```sh
$ python manage.py makemigrations
```

```sh
$ python manage.py migrate
```

## Step 2. Populate with live data

Next, run the custom DHRI command from inside Django's own management script:

```sh
$ python manage.py downloaddata --wipe --all
```

- The `--wipe` parameter resets the database (so it is not necessary if you have just cloned this repository but it's good to keep there to run some housekeeping tasks in other cases).

- The `--all` parameter will download data from _all_ the standard repositories. If you want to see the full list, just run `python manage.py showsettings --repo`. Should you want to make edits, see ["Changing settings"](#changing-settings) below.
