As we think about the automation process of looking at \"big\" data, we have to be aware of [the biases that gets reproduced that is \"hidden.\"](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)\n- De-identified information can be [reconstructed from piecemeal data](https://techscience.org/a/2015092903/)found across different sources. When we consider what we are doing with the data we have collected, we also need to think about the possible re-identification of our participants. \n- Big data projects often times requiring sharing data sets across different individuals and teams. In addition, to ensure that our work is reproducable and accountable, we may also feel inclined to share the data collected. As such, figuring out [how to share such data](https://techscience.org/a/2015101601/) is crucial in the project planning stage.",

            "abstract": "By this point in our academic careers, most of us have figured out some ways we like to interact with computers. Whether that involves avoiding them as much as possible or constantly testing new software, we likely have some ideas about how we feel comfortable getting things done. How would you show a person who had never seen a computer, say [Kimmy Schmidt](https://youtu.be/LIdFa1qLgNQ) or [Brendan Fraser in *Blast from the Past*](https://youtu.be/Xq29uTtKW4M), how to *do* something on your computer?\nMany of us would explain what a screen and a cursor are, and then show how to point and click on icons. This approach relies on a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced \"gooey!\").\nToday we're going to explore another way to make your computer do things: through the command line. Instead of pointing and clicking, we'll be typing in either git bash (Windows) or terminal (macOS) to tell the computer directly what task we'd like it to perform.\nWhile this new technique can seem intimidating if you haven't used text-based interfaces before, luckily, you can use 90% of the functionality of the command line by becoming comfortable with a very small set of the most common commands.",
            "ethical_considerations": "\"The command line\" is also laden with masculine and military metaphors, which is reflective of the history of computing and programming. As Wendy Hui Kyong Chun discusses in [\"On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge\" (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1162/1526381043320741), almost all computers (as in human comput-ers) in the US during World War II were young women. Human computers received commands from analysts——predominantly men with the military—that they then had to interpret and act upon the machine. As Chun (p. 34) argues\n> computation depends on 'yes, sir' in response to short declarative sentences and imperatives that are in essence commands ... The command line is a mere operating system (OS) simulation.\nThe command line (of computers today) receives these commands as text that is typed in.",

These units are known as \"data types\" and include strings (words/letters), integers (numbers), booleans (true or false statements), and lists (groups of strings). The python grammar, which dictates how python statements ought to be ordered, values simplicity, efficiency, and concision. You can read more about python values at [the Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). \nAs we learn about the python data types and grammar, keep in mind that working within any digital format requires making seemingly neutral choices that carry ethical consequences. When using python, be aware of the ways that you approach and transform data into computable form. What choices are you making about your data? What is being included, and what is left out? What are reductions and assumptions necessary to encode your data?",
