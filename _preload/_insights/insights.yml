  text: <p>From time to time, and especially before you start working on a new project
    or when you are running into unexpected issues, you're going to want to make sure
    that your Anaconda installation and its packages are up to date. Through software
    and package updates developers implement new functionalities, usability improvements,
    ensure compatibility with other software, and especially patch known coding flaws.</p>

      open source, but it is also consistent across macOS, Windows, and Linux systems.

      You can follow our download and installation instructions for <a href="https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/visual-studio-code.md">Visual

  text: '<p>An important tool for programming and working in several of the DHRI''s
    workshops is a text editor. A text editor is a program that allows you to edit
    plain text files, such as <code>.txt</code>, <code>.csv</code>, or <code>.md</code>.
    Text editors are not used to edit rich text documents, such as <code>.docx</code>
    or <code>.rtf</code>, and rich text editors should not be used to edit plain text
    files. This is because rich text editors will add many invisible special characters
    that will prevent programs from running and configuration files from being read
    correctly.

    While it doesn''t really matter which text editor you choose, you should try to
    become comfortable with at least one text editor.

    Choosing a text editor has as much to do with personality as it does with functionality.
    Graphical user interfaces (GUIs), user options, and "hackability" vary from program
    to program.</p>'

    text: '<p>Jupyter Notebooks is a form of "computational notebook" (sometimes called
      "Notebook Interfaces"). They have existed for decades, and were created to let
      users to combine software code, computational output, explanatory text and multimedia
      resources in a single document. They became popular among researchers for allowing
      them to annotate procedue, data and findings, making it easier for them to later
      reproduce calculations with different data.

      Jupyter Notebooks have exploded in popularity in the past years, becoming by
      far the most used computational notebook.</p>'

    text: '<p>Jupyter Notebook allows you to write and run codes in containers, which
      we call cells. We won''t go deep into how it works since it can get a bit complicated.
      For the moment, it is enough to know that we can run and see the output of the
      lines of code that are inside a cell.

      To try, type some python code. You can try the classic <code>print("hello world!")</code>
      or anything else you want. To run the cell, press <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>.
      That will give you an output, and create a new cell below.</p>'
    title: Running a cell
  - order: 4
    text: '<p>Your notebook has a kernel, which is like an engine that executes the
      code contained in the cells. Again, we won''t go too deep on this right now.

      What matters is to understand that while you are running codes in a notebook,
      the kernel will remember all the variables you''ve created, libraries you''ve
      imported, etc. And that will be true even if deleted a cell after you ran it.

      This is very powerful, but can be a source of confusion. If you feel you have
      changed things too much, or that you are getting outputs you should not be getting,
      or if you experience some kind of crash, you can always restart the kernel,
      which will "clean" the memory of the kernel, and ask the notebook to run all
      the cells again. In that way, you will guarantee that the kernel will only have
      ran what is currently coded on the cells. To do that, on the top menu, click
      on <code>kernel</code> -&gt; <code>Restart &amp; Run All</code>. You will see
      other options there, feel free to explore them.

      Jupyter Notebook allows you to run cells in any order you want. Again, that
      can be very useful, but it can be quite confusing. At least in the beginning,
      we strongly suggest you to avoid running cells out of order.</p>'
