- explication: '<p>REPL stands for Read, Eval, Print, Loop. It is also known as the
    Python Interpreter or Interactive Shell, and it refers to a Python environment
    that processes your code as soon as you press enter. First, it <strong>Reads</strong>
    your code, then <strong>Evaluates</strong> what you wrote, then <strong>Prints</strong>
    the result (if there is a result), and finally <strong>Loops</strong> back to
    the initial prompt, allowing the user to start the loop again.

    The REPL is useful for testing code on the fly, seeing if it works or what will
    happen. Since the REPL doesn''t save your data after each session, though, you
    need a text editor to write and save longer scripts. Think of the REPL as a sandbox
    or playpen for exploring Python commands and expressions in the moment.

    To use the REPL, just type <code>python</code> into your interpreter. You''ll
    know you''re there when you see the three <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. To get out
    of the REPL, press <code>control-d</code> or type <code>quit()</code>.</p>'

    Institute&lt;/a&gt;</code> contains a link to the Digital Humanities Research

- explication: <p>Branches are not used in the Git session in this curriculum, but
    are a frequently used feature of Git. A branch is an alternative timeline of commits,
    usually used to add a new feature or some other substantive change to a repository.
    Once the feature or change is complete, the branch can be reintegrated with the
    main timeline, which is usually called "master." The process of reintegration
    is referred to as "merging".</p>

    Cloning can be especially useful when you''re joining a group project that is
    hosted on GitHub, and you want your changes to eventually be pushed and shared
    with that same repository.

    Cloning can also be used in conjunction with forking. For example, you could fork
    the GitHub repository of this lesson to your GitHub account, and then clone or
    download the repository to make edits and admendations. Then you would push those
    changes to a repository under your GtiHub account. Git and GitHub work to make

- explication: '<p>The command line is a text-based way of interacting with your computer.
    Another way of looking at it is that the command line is a program that accepts
    commands as text input and converts them into appropriate operating system functions.

    There are other words that can be used synonymously with "command line." Here
    are some of them:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>

    <em>bash</em> - the programming language used in the command line. (Yes, we tricked
    you, you''re already programming!) Short for "Born Again SHell," for reasons people
    on the internet will happily tell you about.</li>

    <li>

    <em>the terminal</em> - Particularly used to refer to the command line on macOS.
    This term made more sense when universities used mainframes and every computer
    was only a terminal.</li>

    <li>

    <em>the shell</em> - The part of an operating system that interacts with a human.
    Technically, anything you do in a graphical interface is also in a shell, but
    in practice this is just another synonym for the command line.</li>

    <li>

    <em>cli</em> - "command-line interface," this is a super technical term for the
    command line used to impress everyone around you.</li>

- explication: '<p>When you commit your changes using Git, you are created a version
    a file that can be referenced even after further changes to the file are made
    and committed.

    Making a commit involves 2 steps.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>First, you need to stage&nbsp;&nbsp;the files, or tell Git, which files it
    should pay attention to. Where are your changes? You use the command <code>git
    add</code> to point to them.</li>

    <li>Second, you create the version by committing the changes. You use the command
    <code>git commit</code> to take the snapshot and add a label (the -m flag) that
    can help you in returning to that version in the future.

    Making a commit is a lot like taking a photo. First, you have to decide who will
    be in the photo and arrange your friends or family in front of the camera (the
    staging process). Once everyone is present and ready, you take the picture, entering
    that moment into the permanent record (the commit process).

    Before any of this can happen, you must initialize the Git folder, or put it on
    Git''s radar. This only needs to happen one time to a folder.</li>

- explication: '<p>Even though you probably don''t know it, you''ve been using objects
    in Python all along. Nearly everything in Python is made out of objects, which
    are representations of values. For example, the string <code>"hello"</code> is
    an object. So is the variable <code>greeting</code> that stores <code>"hello"</code>.
    Integers, floats, and lists are also objects.

    To help you do more complex things with objects, you can learn <em>object-oriented-programming</em>,
    which is an approach toward programming that centralizes objects. This approach
    deploys what we call <em>classes</em> to define and create new objects, as well
    as <em>inheritance</em> to build new objects from old ones. This is definitely
    intermediate stuff, so make sure you have a grasp on basic concepts like data
    types, variables, loops, and conditionals before moving onto object-oriented-programming.</p>'

- explication: <p>Proprietary data file formats are file formats that rely on dedicated,
    licensed softwares and/or systems. These file formats are often copyrighted, patented,
    or have other restrictions placed on them, and often require a fee or a paid-for
    software to open. These file formats are usually discouraged in research projects,
    especially those with intentions to share with a wider public(s) and audience.
    This is distinct from open data formats. Some examples of it include .xslx, .doc,
    and .3ds.</p>
