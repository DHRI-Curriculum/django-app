- explication: "<p>REPL stands for Read, Eval, Print, Loop. It is also known as the\
    \ Python Interpreter or Interactive Shell, and it refers to a Python environment\
    \ that processes your code as soon as you press enter. First, it <strong>Reads</strong>\
    \ your code, then <strong>Evaluates</strong> what you wrote, then <strong>Prints</strong>\
    \ the result (if there is a result), and finally <strong>Loops</strong> back to\
    \ the initial prompt, allowing the user to start the loop again. \nThe REPL is\
    \ useful for testing code on the fly, seeing if it works or what will happen.\
    \ Since the REPL doesn't save your data after each session, though, you need a\
    \ text editor to write and save longer scripts. Think of the REPL as a sandbox\
    \ or playpen for exploring Python commands and expressions in the moment. \nTo\
    \ use the REPL, just type <code>python</code> into your interpreter. You'll know\
    \ you're there when you see the three <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. To get out of\
    \ the REPL, press <code>control-d</code> or type <code>quit()</code>.</p>"

- explication: <p>Attributes offer secondary information about an element in HTML.
    Each attribute is nestled within the element tag. For example, the HTML command
    <code>&lt;a href="https://www.dhinstitutes.org/"&gt;Digital Humanities Research
    Institute&lt;/a&gt;</code> contains a link to the Digital Humanities Research
    Institute website. Here, the <code>a</code> element denotes a hyperlink and the
    <code>href</code> denote an attribute that specifies the hyperlink's destination.</p>
  term: Attributes
- explication: <p>A data type in Python that is either "True" or "False" and is often
    used as a basic building block for logical operations. They are implied in conditional
    statements (which check if expressions are true in order to run a bit of code)

- explication: <p>Branches are not used in the Git session in this curriculum, but
    are a frequently used feature of Git. A branch is an alternative timeline of commits,
    usually used to add a new feature or some other substantive change to a repository.
    Once the feature or change is complete, the branch can be reintegrated with the
    main timeline, which is usually called "master." The process of reintegration
    is referred to as "merging".</p>

- explication: "<p>Cloning a repository means making a copy of a repository on GitHub,\
    \ to download and work on locally--on your local machine. \nCloning can be especially\
    \ useful when you're joining a group project that is hosted on GitHub, and you\
    \ want your changes to eventually be pushed and shared with that same repository.\
    \ \nCloning can also be used in conjunction with forking. For example, you could\
    \ fork the GitHub repository of this lesson to your GitHub account, and then clone\
    \ or download the repository to make edits and admendations. Then you would push\
    \ those changes to a repository under your GtiHub account. Git and GitHub work\
    \ to make sure attribution of contributions and lineage are transparent.</p>"

- explication: '<p>The command line is a text-based way of interacting with your computer.
    Another way of looking at it is that the command line is a program that accepts
    commands as text input and converts them into appropriate operating system functions.

    There are other words that can be used synonymously with "command line." Here
    are some of them:

    - <em>bash</em> - the programming language used in the command line. (Yes, we
    tricked you, you''re already programming!) Short for "Born Again SHell," for reasons
    people on the internet will happily tell you about.

    - <em>the terminal</em> - Particularly used to refer to the command line on macOS.
    This term made more sense when universities used mainframes and every computer
    was only a terminal.

    - <em>the shell</em> - The part of an operating system that interacts with a human.
    Technically, anything you do in a graphical interface is also in a shell, but
    in practice this is just another synonym for the command line.

    - <em>cli</em> - "command-line interface," this is a super technical term for
    the command line used to impress everyone around you.</p>'

- explication: "<p>When you commit your changes using Git, you are created a version\
    \ a file that can be referenced even after further changes to the file are made\
    \ and committed. \nMaking a commit involves 2 steps. \n- First, you need to stage&nbsp;&nbsp;the\
    \ files, or tell Git, which files it should pay attention to. Where are your changes?\
    \ You use the command <code>git add</code> to point to them. \n- Second, you create\
    \ the version by committing the changes. You use the command <code>git commit</code>\
    \ to take the snapshot and add a label (the -m flag) that can help you in returning\
    \ to that version in the future.\nMaking a commit is a lot like taking a photo.\
    \ First, you have to decide who will be in the photo and arrange your friends\
    \ or family in front of the camera (the staging process). Once everyone is present\
    \ and ready, you take the picture, entering that moment into the permanent record\
    \ (the commit process).\nBefore any of this can happen, you must initialize the\
    \ Git folder, or put it on Git's radar. This only needs to happen one time to\

- explication: <p><code>lower()</code> is a string method for making all of the letters
    within a string into lowercase letters. It uses the dot syntax <code>.</code>

    by running <code>"HELLO".lower()</code>, which will return the string <code>'hello'</code>.</p>

- explication: '<p>Markdown is the language used to format the plain text files in
    your Git-enabled repository. Its also called a markup language, like HTML. Both
    languages add markers to plain text to style and organize the text of a document.

    In HTML:</p>

    <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">&lt;</span><span
    class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> Heading 1 <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span

- explication: "<p>A method in Python is similar to a function, in that it allows\
    \ us to do things with data. However, a method is attached to what we call an\
    \ <em>object</em>, which is a representation of data. Accordingly, a method operates\
    \ as a function that is specifically available for that object. \nMethods are\
    \ accessed through the dot syntax <code>.</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the\
    \ method <code>lower()</code> can be attached to a string object like so: <code>\"\
    HELLO\".lower()</code> and will return the string <code>'hello'</code>.</p>"

- explication: "<p>A module is a python file (like a script) that contains a number\

    \ to your script with <code>import</code> and then indicate which function you\
    \ want to use with the dot syntax <code>.</code>. For example, we might use the\

- explication: "<p>Even though you probably don't know it, you've been using objects\
    \ in Python all along. Nearly everything in Python is made out of objects, which\
    \ are representations of values. For example, the string <code>\"hello\"</code>\
    \ is an object. So is the variable <code>greeting</code> that stores <code>\"\
    hello\"</code>. Integers, floats, and lists are also objects. \nTo help you do\
    \ more complex things with objects, you can learn <em>object-oriented-programming</em>,\
    \ which is an approach toward programming that centralizes objects. This approach\
    \ deploys what we call <em>classes</em> to define and create new objects, as well\
    \ as <em>inheritance</em> to build new objects from old ones. This is definitely\
    \ intermediate stuff, so make sure you have a grasp on basic concepts like data\
    \ types, variables, loops, and conditionals before moving onto object-oriented-programming.</p>"
