text: "I slowly got into building websites and web-based projects. It started with\
  \ using WordPress to build a public profile to share my work and research interests.\
  \ Over time, it has melded into a critical component of my approach to public scholarship\
  \ and education. A critical step in this evolution was attending the DRI where I\
  \ gained a foundational understanding of the larger ecosystem of digital tools of\
  \ which WordPress was one small part. Critical for me was understanding the different\
  \ affordances and relationships between different digital tools and environments.\
  \ I now understand a lot more of what I\u2019m doing, technically, when I\u2019\
  m working with those tools. This helps me in understanding what tools I need for\
  \ a specific task and how they could be integrated to best support my ambitions\
  \ for a project, and what work-arounds I might explore if needed. Sometimes it can\
  \ still be a headache, but definitely less so with time, and I\u2019ve learned to\
  \ reframe the frustration as an opportunity to reach out to colleagues and/or learn\
  \ a new tool or technique. And the rewards of doing this work over time are evident\
  \ today: my dissertation includes a web-based project that integrates a few different\
  \ tools already, with plans for expansion (https://recalibratingqueens.nyc) and\
  \ I work as a consultant on multiple web-based projects."
