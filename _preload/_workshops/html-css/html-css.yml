  abstract: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create and organize the content
    of a website. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for website design and layout.
    Together, these languages form the foundation of what one needs to know to create
    useful and well-designed websites. This workshop walks participants through the
    fundamentals of HTML and CSS. The purpose of this website is to help participants
    understand the rudiments of making websites, with the intention of providing a
    strong base of knowledge from which to imagine web-based digital humanities projects.

  ethical_considerations:
  - <p>Building websites can involve making information public on the internet, which
    raises a host of intellectual property legal concerns. It is very important to
    make sure that you prominently declare which creative commons licenses you are
    using for your website so that visitors to your website are aware of the ways
    in which they can use the information that you are providing. Learn more about
    choosing the appropriate creative commons license here on <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/"
    rel="nofollow">the Creative Commons website</a>. Similarly, if your website uses
    images, videos, or any kind of document from other sources (like archives, artists,
    newspapers, etc.) you must be sure to cite these sources and make sure that you
    have the necessary permissions to reproduce these works.</p>
  - <p>Creating websites also involves making sure that it is designed to be accessible
    for those with disabilities. If your website displays images, then each image
    should also contain <a href="https://accessibility.psu.edu/images/alttext/" rel="nofollow">alt
    text</a> metadata that describes the image such that it is usable for screenreaders.
    Screenreaders make websites accessible for those with visual and/or auditory disabilities.
    Similarly, if your website involves showcasing audio-based information (like interviews
    or lectures) then you should provide a transcription of the audio. We will go
    over basic practices of making websites accessbile in this workshop. You can learn
    more about accessibility standards and guidelines at the <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility"
    rel="nofollow">W3C's page on Web Accessibility</a>. Furthermore, there are also
    services like the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" rel="nofollow">WAVE tool</a>
    that help identify ways of making websites more accessible.</p>

      transform data.'
  solution: ''
  text: "<p>Websites seem like these magical things that appear when we open our web\
    \ browser (i.e. Chrome, Firefox, Safari). We know that websites are hypertext,\
    \ meaning that we can click between links, travelling from page to page until\
    \ we find what we need. What may be less obvious about websites is that, fundamentally\
    \ <strong>websites are plain text documents</strong>, usually written in HTML\
    \ or another web-based markup language, such as XML or XHTML.</p>\n<p><em>Fun\
    \ fact</em>: <strong>More than 90% of all websites (whose markup language we know)\
    \ use HTML</strong>\n<a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ml-html/all/all\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">(w3techs.com)</a>.</p>\n<h2>\n<a aria-hidden=\"\

    ><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Hypertext\
    \ Markup Language (HTML)</h2>\n<p>HTML is a markup language used to write web-based\
    \ documents. It enables us to provide web browsers with information about the\
    \ <em>content</em> of a document. We can, for example, indicate that some part\
    \ of our document is a paragraph, image, heading, or link. The browser uses this\
    \ information when displaying the document for users.</p>\n<h2>\n<a aria-hidden=\"\
    true\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#markup-language-vs-programming-language\" id=\"\
    user-content-markup-language-vs-programming-language\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\"\
    \ class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Markup Language vs. Programming Language</h2>\n\
    <p>HTML is a <em>markup</em> language, not a programming language. Programming\
    \ languages are used to transform data, by creating scripts that organize an output\
    \ of data based on a particular input of data. A markup language is used to control\
    \ the presentation of data.</p>\n<p>For a practical example of this difference,\
    \ we can think about tables. A programming language can help you search through\
    \ a table, understand the kinds of data the table includes, find particular data\
    \ points, or transform its content into other kinds of data, such as frequencies.\
    \ A markup language would instead determine the content, layout, and visual presentation\
    \ of the table.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, then, a script or program is a set of instructions\
    \ given to the computer. A document in a markup language determines how information\
    \ is presented to a user.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE\u2014Markup vs Markdown:</strong>\
    \ Markdown and HTML are both types of markup languages; Markdown is a play on\
    \ words. Markup languages help format content.</p>\n<h2>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\"\
    \ class=\"anchor\" href=\"#cascading-style-sheets-css\" id=\"user-content-cascading-style-sheets-css\"\
    ><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Cascading\
    \ Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>\n<p>CSS is usually used in conjunction with HTML. HTML\
    \ tells the browser what the different parts of a document <em>are</em>. CSS tells\
    \ the browser what the parts of the document should <em>look like</em>. It is\
    \ essentially a set of rules that are applied when rendering an HTML document.\
    \ Its name\u2014Cascading Style Sheets\u2014refers to the fact that there is an\
    \ order of precedence in how the browswer applies CSS rules to a document. More\
    \ specific rules overwrite less specific rules.</p>\n<h2>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\"\
    \ class=\"anchor\" href=\"#where-does-the-internet-come-in\" id=\"user-content-where-does-the-internet-come-in\"\
    ><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Where Does\
    \ the Internet Come In?</h2>\n<p>Together, these languages can be used to write\
    \ and style a website using a text editor (such as Visual Studio Code) directly\
    \ from your computer. No internet access needed.</p>\n<p>However, internet access\
    \ is necessary if you plan on making your website available to the public. At\
    \ the end of this workshop, we will briefly discuss <a href=\"?page=19\">how to\
    \ get your website from your local computer onto the internet</a>.</p>\n<p>In\
    \ our activities during this workshop we will focus on building locally-hosted\
    \ websites. These are websites that you can open on your web browser, however,\
    \ they only exist on your own device and are only accessible to you. Locally-hosted\

  title: Opening Activity
  workshop: html-css
- challenge: '<p>Create a folder called <code>htmlpractice</code> in your projects
    folder (<code>~/Desktop/projects/htmlpractice</code>). Inside that folder, create
    a new text file and save it as <code>index.html</code>.</p>

    <p>Let''s use the command line to create the new folder and file:</p>

    <ol>

    <li>

    <p>Open your terminal.</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>Navigate to your projects folder using this command:</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-text-shell-session"><pre>$ <span class="pl-s1"><span
    class="pl-c1">cd</span> <span class="pl-k">~</span>/Desktop/projects</span></pre></div>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>Create a new folder:</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-text-shell-session"><pre>$ <span class="pl-s1">mkdir
    htmlpractice</span></pre></div>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>Use your Visual Studio Code text editor to create a file called <code>index.html</code>:
    <code>code index.html</code>.</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>Paste the template above (starting with <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>)
    into the new file.</p>

    </li>

    </ol>

    <p>The <code>index.html</code> file is your default homepage for the website we
    are creating. This is an industry standard, because web browsers tend to recognize
    the <code>index.html</code> page as the opening page to the directory that is
    your website. See <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/index-html-page-3466505" rel="nofollow">here</a>
    for more explanation.</p>

    <p>Once you''ve created your new file, open it with a web browser using your graphical
    user interface:</p>

    <p>On macOS, click on the Finder in your dock (the apps at the bottom of the screen)
    and click on Desktop on the left. From there, navigate to <code>projects</code>,
    then <code>htmlpractice</code>. Alternately, you can click the projects folder
    icon on your Desktop and find it from there. If you''re using a Mac and would
    prefer to use the command line, you can also type <code>open index.html</code>
    from within your <code>htmlpractice</code> folder.</p>

    <p>On Windows, click the <code>projects</code> folder icon on your desktop. Navigate
    to <code>projects</code>, then <code>htmlpractice</code>. Double click the <code>index.html</code>
    file. If it does not open in a browser, right click the <code>index.html</code>
    icon and select "Open with..." from the menu. Select Firefox or Google Chrome
    from the app list that appears.</p>'

    question: 'True or False: Does including "alt text" in websites improve their
      accessibility?'
  solution: ''
  text: '<p>Images are another important component of websites. Sometimes these just
    help bring your website to life, but other times they can help communicate information
    to users.</p>

    <p>Images are created with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. Similar to the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
    tag, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> requires an attribute, in this case <code>src</code>.
    The <code>src</code> attribute stands for "source" and communicates secondary
    information to your browser that identifies and locates the image. Unlike many
    other tags, the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag does not need to be closed, making
    it an example of a void tag.</p>

    <p>The following element pulls in an image located in the same folder as the <code>.html</code>
    file:</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-text-html-basic"><pre><span class="pl-kos">&lt;</span><span
    class="pl-ent">img</span> <span class="pl-c1">src</span>="<span class="pl-s">scream.jpeg</span>"
    /&gt;</pre></div>

    <p>The same rules apply here as with the <code>href</code> attribute: if the image
    is not located in the same folder as the document you are writing in, the browser
    won''t find it. If the browser cannot find an image resource, you will see a broken
    image icon, such as this one from Chrome:</p>

    <p><a href="/static/website/images/lessons/html-css/broken.png" rel="noopener
    noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Chrome broken image icon" class="img-fluid
    d-block my-4" src="/static/website/images/lessons/html-css/broken.png" style="max-width:100%;"/></a></p>

    <p>Note: Some sites use a lot of images. When this is the case, it can be helpful
    to keep images in a separate folder within your site''s structure. To enable the
    browser to find an image in that case, just add the directory in front of the
    file name. For example, if you have a folder named images in the same folder as
    your index.html file, and scream.jpeg is in that folder, you''d change the void
    tag above to <code>&lt;img src="images/scream.jpeg" /&gt;</code>.</p>

    <h2>

    <a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#making-images-accessible" id="user-content-making-images-accessible"><span
    aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Making Images Accessible</h2>

    <p>As briefly noted earlier, alternative text, or alt text, is descriptive "text
    associated with an image that serves the same purpose and conveys the same essential
    information as the image" (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Accessibility/Alternative_text_for_images"
    rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia Manual of Style/Accessibility/Alternative
    Text for Images</a> for more), and is important for ensuring content conveyed
    by images is accessible to all.</p>

    <p>To add alternative text to an image, you add an additional attribute, <code>alt</code>
    followed by your descriptive text. For example:</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-text-html-basic"><pre><span class="pl-kos">&lt;</span><span
    class="pl-ent">img</span> <span class="pl-c1">src</span>="<span class="pl-s">filename.png</span>"
    <span class="pl-c1">alt</span>="<span class="pl-s">Text in these quotes describes
    the image</span>" /&gt;</pre></div>

    <p>For more information about using alt text, see what the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/files/SSA_Alternative_Text_Guide.pdf"
    rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Social Security Administration</a> has to say.</p>

    id="user-content-what-images-may-i-use-on-my-site"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon
    octicon-link"></span></a>What Images May I Use On My Site?</h2>

    <p>If you''re planning to use images that you did not take or make yourself, you''ll
    need to use "public domain" or "open license" images.</p>

  solution: ''
  text: '<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This language works in coordination
    with HTML, but is its own language with its own rules and terminology. In contrast
    to HTML, which is responsible for the content of the page, CSS is responsible
    for the presentation of the page.</p>

    <p>Examples of what CSS can help you determine include:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>What background color you want to use for the page or a paragraph.</li>

    <li>What font or font size you want for your headings or your normal text.</li>

    <li>How large you want the images, and whether you want them aligned center, left,

    \ CSS is for <em>styling</em>. (This is sometimes referred to as the principle\
    \ of <a href=\"https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">\"separation of concerns\"</a>)</li>\n<li>It\
    \ helps us maintain consistency across the various pages of our site as <em>multiple\
    \ HTML files can link to the same stylesheet</em>.</li>\n<li>Because multiple\
    \ HTML files can link to the same CSS file, it's not necessary to write the same\
    \ CSS code multiple times. Once suffices. (This is sometimes referred to as the\
    \ <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\"\
    \ target=\"_blank\">\"Don't Repeat Yourself\" principle</a>, or simply <em>DRY</em>.)</li>\n\

  text: "<p>CSS is based on selectors and declarations, which together form rule sets\
    \ (or just \"rules\"). Rule sets comprise an external styling file with a <code>.css</code>\
    \ extension. Here is the contents of a sample <code>.css</code> file:</p>\n<div\
    \ class=\"highlight highlight-source-css\"><pre><span class=\"pl-ent\">h1</span>\

    pl-c1\">background-color</span>: grey;\n\_\_\_\_<span class=\"pl-c1\">color</span>:\
    \ dark-grey;\n}</pre></div>\n<p>The first rule (which starts with the <code>h1</code>\
    \ selector) applies to all <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags on each page where your\
    \ HTML document links to your stylesheet, and changes the font style and display\
    \ of those headings.</p>\n<p>The lines within the curly braces (i.e. <code>{ ...\
    \ }</code>) are called <strong>declarations</strong>, and they change the formatting\
    \ of the elements in the HTML document. Each line in the declaration sets the\
    \ value for a <strong>property</strong> and ends with a semicolon (<code>;</code>).</p>\n\
    <p>Note the different syntax being used to select items for for styling with rule\
    \ sets. The bottom two selectors are used to apply rule sets to <strong>IDs</strong>\
    \ and <strong>classes</strong>. In general, adding classes and IDs to HTML elements\
    \ allows for more specific styling\u2014more on these soon!</p>\n<h2>\n<a aria-hidden=\"\

    \ Happen?</h2>\n<p>The formatting of the text on your page should change accordingly.\
    \ Your <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> should be orange and italic, for example.</p>\n\
    <p>What are some other rules you might set for different HTML elements? Do a quick\
    \ Google search for a CSS rule that changes the appearance of your page, such\
    \ as putting a border around an element.</p>"

  text: "<p>Some of you may be wondering whether it matters what order you add the\

    \ an automatic filtering function where <strong>the most specific rule in CSS\
    \ always takes precedence.</strong></p>\n<p>So if your stylesheet contained the\
    \ following rule sets:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-css\"><pre><span\

    \ of your paragraph would be green, but where the strong tag is found in the paragraph,\
    \ the text would be bold and red. In other words, the more specific styling for\
    \ the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> text in your paragraph will override the less\
    \ specific styling of the paragraph in general. This would occur <strong>regardless\
    \ of the order these rule sets appear in the stylesheet.</strong></p>\n<p>This\
    \ rule also applies to how you integrate CSS into your HTML to style your content.\
    \ For example, if you link to an external stylesheet, and you add inline or internal\

  text: "<p>Classes and IDs enable more fine-grained styling by allowing you to define\

  text: '<p>Using the CSS basics we''ve just reviewed, and the list of properties
    found on the <a href="?page=15">Properties page</a> and online, give your website
    some styling.</p>

    <p>I encourage you to use an external stylesheet with classes and IDs to style
    particular aspects of your site more specifically, but feel free to also play
    around with inline and internal styling if desired.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Change the color and size of your heading text.</li>

    <li>Change the font of your paragraph text.</li>

    <li>Change the background color of your navigation bar or menu.</li>

    <li>Center your image on your page.</li>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/html-css/blob/v2.0/sections/_navbar-hint.md">Shape
    up your navigation bar.</a></li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> After creating a stylesheet, you must link it to
    all HTML documents that you want this styling to apply to. You can do so with
    the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag:</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-text-html-basic"><pre><span class="pl-kos">&lt;</span><span
    class="pl-ent">link</span> <span class="pl-c1">rel</span>="<span class="pl-s">stylesheet</span>"

    class="pl-s">style.css</span>" /&gt;</pre></div>

    <p>This will tell your HTML document to apply the style rules from the text file
    named <code>style.css</code> in the same folder.</p>'

  text: "<p>Through this workshop, you have learned the basics of two of the most\
    \ commonly-used languages for building on the web: HTML and CSS.</p>\n<p>HTML,\
    \ or Hypertext Markup Language, organizes content on your page using elements\
    \ denoted by tags (<code>&lt;...&gt;</code>). When rendered by your browser, these\
    \ tags tell your browser that certain content is paragraph text, while other content\
    \ is heading or title text, and so on. You can also use image (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>)\
    \ and link or anchor (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) tags to tell the browser to render\
    \ an image on the page, or take the visitor to another page on your or another\
    \ website. We also discussed some important conventions to consider when creating\
    \ HTML documents, such as nesting.</p>\n<p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, allows\
    \ for further styling of your website through the application of a series of rule\
    \ sets that are applied to different aspects/elements of your site. In order for\
    \ CSS to render on a webpage, it must be integrated with your html, which can\
    \ happen in three ways: inline, internal, and external. CSS rules can be of varying\
    \ specificity, and in particular, through creating classes and IDs. We also discussed\
    \ how the ordering of rule sets doesn't matter, because an important function\
    \ of CSS is the way it filters and applies rules in accordance with the specificity\
    \ of the rule.</p>\n<p>Through understanding these languages in combination with\
    \ one another, you can also reframe your understanding of the web\u2014not as\
    \ <em>poof! magic!</em>, but as a series of intentionally styled, hyperlinked\
    \ text documents, with each website representing a folder of documents.</p>\n\
    <p>While this is a good starting point, one important question remains: how can\
    \ I get these text documents on the Internet so they can be accessed, and interacted\
    \ with, and linked to by others? This is what we will discuss in the final lesson\

  - label: In this workshop, we have focused on the fundametals of HTML and CSS. The
      point was to provide an introduction to the workings of websites. In practice,
      however, the websites that we desire to build will have complex use cases. What
      are some websites that you imagine building? What kinds of interactive features
      would you like to have in your website?

    workshop: html-css
  - label: Some websites provide information clearly and in an enaging manner. Others
      might inundate with a barrage of content that leaves one mystified. What would
      you say are some of the characteristics of well-designed websites? Which websites
      do you consider a joy to use? What design elements (such as font, color, layout,
      and menus) stand out to you as being particularly important in making good websites?

  intro: '<p>This workshop has provided an introduction to HTML and CSS. Through its
    discussion of tags, elements, and attributes, we have tried to cover the basic
    ways in which web pages are initially constructed in plaintext and then rendered
    on browsers. As we concieve of digital humanities projects, however, our visions
    quickly exceed the capacity of the commands that was covered in this workshop.
    Not only might we be interested in making information public on the internet,
    but we might also be interested in providing tools that facilitate interactivity
    and ease of use with the content that we are curating. Building these tools and
    incorporating them in our websites requires the additional knowledge of languages
    like javascript, SQL, and python, among many others. Digital humanities projects
    are often collaborative endeavors and bringing someone into the project who has
    these skills is an effective way to building well-designed websites.

    Another way to build more complex design and functionality into your websites
    is by using a Content Management System (CMS), which refers to a suite of tools
    that facilitates easy website development and hosting on the internet. Most modern-day
    websites require functionalities that strains the limits of HTML and CSS. Content
    Management Systems allow users without any familiarity with advanced web-design
    languages and concepts to quickly build websites that are visually appealing and
    contain a variety of features. CMS platforms often provide a variety of tools
    that users can simply click, drag, and input content to create websites. No coding
    required! Popular content management systems in the digital humanities include
    <a href="https://www.omeka.net/" rel="nofollow">Omeka</a>, <a href="https://scalar.me/anvc/scalar/"
    rel="nofollow">Scalar</a>, <a href="https://www.springshare.com/libguides/" rel="nofollow">Libguides</a>,
    and <a href="https://wordpress.org/" rel="nofollow">Wordpress</a>. These CMS have
    robust documentation and an active user community, both of which can help solve
    issues in website development. The suggested readings and tutorials provided below
    link to more information on selecting and using a CMS.</p>'

  - annotation: '[W3Schools CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
      covers a lot more ground with CSS and provides very helpful "how to" guides
      for making menus and integrating with other websites.'

  - annotation: '[Omeka](https://www.omeka.net/) is a platform for building digital
      archives and digital exhibits. It is designed to help those without deep technical
      knowledge build simple interactive websites. Instead of using HTML and CSS,
      Omeka provides a [Graphical User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)
      for building websites. Omeka is a wonderful point of beginning to understand
      how a content management system works. Graduate Center Digital Fellow and digital
      archivist, Stefano Morello, has put together a very helpful workshop on [getting
      started with Omeka](https://github.com/GCDigitalFellows/omeka).'

  - annotation: '[Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) is the most widely used content
      management service. Similar to Omeka, it provides a Graphical User Interface
      for building websites. However, unlike Omeka, Wordpress provides many additional
      functionalities that vary in their use, scale, and complexity. Wordpress can
      be used to make a variety of different kinds of websites, from course-websites
      to scholarly publications, and much more. The [Wordpress Turorial for Beginners](https://wordpress.com/learn/)
      provides a helpful introduction to this tool. '

  - annotation: '[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) can be useful to more advanced
      users for hosting HTML/CSS files and publishing them directly on the internet.
      It draws on a Github repository to build static websites. Websites that are
      hosted on Github pages tend to have a URL that ends in `github.io`. The official
      Github documentation has a well written guide on [creating a Github Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).'
