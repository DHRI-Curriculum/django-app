text: "My interests in digital humanities emerges at the intersection of digital archives\
  \ and website development. I am particularly inspired by the ways in which digital\
  \ archives like the South Asian American Digital Archive, the HathiTrust Digital\
  \ Library, and Chronicling America, among many others, provide us with relatively\
  \ easy access to an abundance of historical documents. I am eager to learn new ways\
  \ of creatively using the materials provided by these digital archives to curate\
  \ historical moments and raise cultural questions. These interests started to shape\
  \ up during my first year as a graduate student, when I worked on a digital exhibition\
  \ project called Latin American Jewish Writers and Artists. This opportunity allowed\
  \ me to work with research conducted over many decades to preserve the cultural\
  \ heritage of the Latin American Jewish community. I was part of the team that decided\
  \ how the videos, images, and documents in this collection would be presented to\
  \ the public. The discussions we had regarding the design and layout of the website\
  \ often led to discussions of larger issues of cultural significance, politics,\
  \ and memory. I found the whole exercise to be immensely intellectually enriching\
  \ and I\u2019ve been teaching and learning with websites and digital archives ever\
  \ since."
