  abstract: Digital technologies have made vast amounts of text available to researchers,
    and this same technological moment has provided us with the capacity to analyze
    that text faster than humanly possible. The first step in that analysis is to
    transform texts designed for human consumption into a form a computer can analyze.
    Using Python and the Natural Language ToolKit (commonly called NLTK), this workshop
    introduces strategies to turn qualitative texts into quantitative objects. Through
    that process, we will present a variety of strategies for simple analysis of text-based
    data.

  ethical_considerations:
  - <p>In working with massive amounts of text, it is natural to lose the original
    context. We must be aware of that and be careful when analizing it.</p>
  - <p>It is important to constantly question our assumptions and the indexes we are
    using. Numbers and graphs do not tell the story, our analysis does. We must be
    careful not to draw hasty and simplistic conclusions for things that are complex.
    Just because we found out that author A uses more unique words than author B,
    does it mean that A is a better writer than B?</p>
  learning_objectives:
  - <p>How to prepare texts for computational analysis, including strategies for transforming
    texts into numbers</p>

      correct:
      - Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging can help identifying verbs, adjectives and nouns
        in a text.
      incorrect:
      - A text is not data in itself, but can produce data if converted into numbers.

  text: "<p>When we think of \"data,\" we often think of numbers, things that can\
    \ be summarized, statisticized, and graphed. Rarely when I ask people \"what is\
    \ data?\" do they respond \"<em>Moby Dick</em>.\" And yet, more and more, text\
    \ is data. Whether it is <em>Moby Dick</em>, or every romance novel written since\
    \ 1750, or today's newspaper or twitter feed, we are able to transform written\
    \ (and spoken) language into data that can be quantified and visualized. That\
    \ has been done for a while, but now we can do it in a much larger scale, in a\
    \ much faster way.</p>\n<h2>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"\
    #corpora\" id=\"user-content-corpora\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon\
    \ octicon-link\"></span></a>Corpora</h2>\n<p>The first step in gathering insights\
    \ from texts is to create a <strong>corpus</strong>. A corpus is a collection\
    \ of texts that are somehow related to each other. For example, the <a href=\"\
    https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Corpus of Contemporary\
    \ American English</a>, <a href=\"http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/\" rel=\"\
    nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Trump's Tweets</a>, <a href=\"https://byts.commons.gc.cuny.edu/\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">text messages</a> sent by bilingual young\
    \ adults, <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\
    \ target=\"_blank\">digitized newspapers</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">books</a> in the public domain are all corpora.\
    \ There are infinitely many corpora, and, sometimes, you will want to make your\
    \ own\u2014that is, one that best fits your research question.</p>\n<p>The route\
    \ you take from here will depend on your research question. Let's say, for example,\
    \ that you want to examine gender differences in writing style. Based on previous\
    \ linguistic research, you hypothesize that male-identified authors use more definitives\
    \ than female-identified. So you collect two corpora\u2014one written by men,\
    \ one written by women\u2014and you count the number of <em>the</em>s, <em>this</em>s,\
    \ and <em>that</em>s compared to the number of <em>a</em>s, <em>an</em>s, and\
    \ <em>one</em>s. Maybe you find a difference, maybe you don't. We can already\
    \ see that this is a relatively crude way of going about answering this question,\
    \ but it is a start.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that, oftentimes our analysis of gender\
    \ assumes pre-existing gender roles that reproduce gender as a binary system.\
    \ Some digital humanists have pointed out that, if gender is binary, then the\
    \ relation between male and female will likely be one of opposition. As <a href=\"\
    https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-f2acf72c-a469-49d8-be35-67f9ac1e3a60/section/5d9c1b63-7b60-42dd-8cda-bde837f638f4#ch01\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Laura Mandell</a> says, the categories of\
    \ \"male\" and \"female\" are socially constructed, and quantitative analysis\
    \ practitioners should avoid jumping to conclusions about \"male\" and \"female\"\
    \ styles of thinking and writing \"as if the M/F terms were simple pointers to\
    \ an unproblematic reality, transparently referential and not discursively constituted.\"\
    </p>\n<p>There has been some research about how the <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/331/6014/176.full.pdf\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">linguistic complexity of written language</a>\
    \ in long-form pieces (i.e., books, articles, letters, etc.) has decreased over\
    \ time. Simply put, people today use shorter sentences with fewer embedded clauses\
    \ and complex tense constructions than people did in the past. (Note that this\
    \ is not necessarily a bad or good thing.) Based on this research, we want to\
    \ know if short-form platforms are emblematic of the change (we predict that they\
    \ are based on our own experience with short-form platforms like email and Twitter).\
    \ One way to do this would be to use Part-of-Speech tagging. Part-of-Speech (POS)\
    \ tagging is a way to identify the category of words in a given text.</p>\n<p>For\
    \ example, the sentence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I like the red bicycle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\
    <p>has one pronoun, one verb, one determiner, one adjective, and one noun.</p>\n\
    <blockquote>\n<p>(<strong>I</strong> : Pronoun), (<strong>like</strong> : Verb),\
    \ (<strong>the</strong> : Determiner), (<strong>red</strong> : Adjective), (<strong>bicycle</strong>\
    \ : Noun)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>NLTK uses the <a href=\"https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Penn Tree Bank Tag Set</a>. This is a very\
    \ detailed tag list that goes far beyond just nouns, verbs, and adjectives, but\
    \ gives insight into different types of nouns, prepositions, and verbs as well.\
    \ Virtually all POS taggers will create a list of (word, POS) pairs. If newspaper\
    \ articles have a higher ratio of function words (prepositions, auxiliaries, determiners,\
    \ etc.) to semantic words (nouns, verbs, adjectives), than tweets, then we have\
    \ one piece of evidence supporting our hypothesis. It's important to note here\
    \ that we must use either ratios or otherwise normalized data (in the sense that\
    \ raw numbers will not work). Because of the way that language works (function\
    \ words are often repeated, for example), a sample of 100 words will have more\
    \ unique words than a sample of 1,000. Therefore, to compare different data types\
    \ (articles vs. tweets), this fact should be taken into account.</p>\n<h2>\n<a\

  keywords:
  - Machine Learning
  - Text Normalization
  order: 2
  questions:
  - answers:
      correct:
      - In any type of data analysis, we usually want to cleanse the data in order
        to prepare it for the analysis. In text analysis, this process is called "text
        normalization" and can involve tasks such as removing undesired words and
        punctuation.
      incorrect:
      - Stop words are useless for text analysis, therefore the first step in any
        project is to remove them from the text.
      - Textual alterations can potentially change the original intended meaning.
        Therefore, we must always strive to work with the data exactly as it is in
        the source.
    question: 'Check all sentences below that are correct:'
  solution: ''
  solution_title: ''
  text: "<p>Generally, however, our questions are more about topics rather than writing\
    \ style. So, once we have a corpus\u2014whether that is one text or millions\u2014\
    we usually want to clean and normalize it. There are three terms we are going\
    \ to need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Text normalization</strong> is the process\
    \ of taking a list of words and transforming it into a more uniform sequence.\
    \ Usually, this involves removing punctuation, making the words all the same case,\
    \ removing <em>stop words</em>, and either <em>stemming</em> or <em>lemmatizing</em>\
    \ the words. It can also include expanding abbreviations or matching misspellings\
    \ (but these are advanced practices that we will not cover).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You\
    \ probably know what removing punctuation and capitalization refer to, but the\
    \ other terms may be new:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stop words</strong> are\
    \ words that appear frequently in a language, often adding grammatical structure,\
    \ but little semantic content. There is no official list of stop words for any\
    \ language, though there are some common, all-purpose lists built in to NLTK.\
    \ However, different tasks require different lists. The purpose of removing stop\
    \ words is to remove words that are so common that their meaning is diminished\
    \ across a large number of texts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stemming and lemmatizing</strong>\
    \ both of these processes try to consolidate words like \"laughs\" and \"laughing\"\
    \ to\_\_\"laugh\" since they all mean essentially the same thing, they are just\
    \ inflected differently. So again, in an attempt to reduce the number of words,\
    \ and get a realistic understanding of the meaning of a text, these words are\
    \ collapsed. Stemming does this by cutting off the end (very fast), lemmatizing\
    \ does this by looking up the dictionary form (very slow).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\
    <p>Language is messy, and created for and by people, not computers. There is a\
    \ lot of grammatical information in a sentence that a computer cannot use. For\
    \ example, I could say to you:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The house is burning.</p>\n\
    </blockquote>\n<p>and you would understand me. You would also understand if I\
    \ say</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>house burn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first has more\
    \ information about tense, and which house in particular, but the sentiment is\
    \ the same either way.</p>\n<p>In going from the first sentence to the normalized\
    \ words, we removed the stop words (<em>the</em> and <em>is</em>), and removed\
    \ punctuation and case, and lemmatized what was left (<em>burning</em> becomes\
    \ <em>burn</em>\u2014though we might have stemmed this, its impossible to tell\
    \ from the example). This results in what is essentially a \"bag of words,\" or\
    \ a corpus of words without any structure. Because normalizing your text reduces\
    \ the number of words (and therefore the number of dimensions in your data), and\
    \ keeps only the words that contribute meaning to the document, this cleaning\
    \ is usually desirable.</p>\n<p>This is a very important topic in Machine Learning\
    \ tutorials. For the time being, we just need to know that there is \"clean\"\
    \ and \"dirty\" versions of text data. Sometimes our questions are about the clean\
    \ data, but sometimes our questions are in the \"dirt.\"</p>\n<h2>\n<a aria-hidden=\"\

    ><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>A Note on\
    \ Ethics</h2>\n<p>The act of cleaning/normalizing subscribes text to predetermined\
    \ categories of meaning, forcing meaning into existing \"boxes,\" so to speak.\
    \ This doesn't mean that we should avoid cleaning or normalizing text, but that\
    \ we should be aware of how some textual reductions have the potential to affect\
    \ meaning. How does quantification reinforce differences or stratifications within\
    \ our data? We have to be careful about the kinds of questions we are asking,\
    \ and how we might be reproducing some of our assumptions in our inquiry.</p>\n\

  text: "<p>Let's start by analyzing <em>Moby Dick</em>, which is <code>text1</code>\
    \ for NLTK.</p>\n<p>The first function we will look at is <code>concordance</code>.\
    \ \"Concordance\" in this context means the characters on either side of the word.\
    \ Our text is behaving like one giant string, so concordance will just count the\
    \ number of characters on either side. By default, this is 25 characters on either\
    \ side of our target word (including spaces), but <a href=\"http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/text.html#Text.concordance\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">you can change that if you want</a>.</p>\n\
    <p>In the Jupyter Notebook, type:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-python\"\
    ><pre><span class=\"pl-s1\">text1</span>.<span class=\"pl-en\">concordance</span>(<span\
    \ class=\"pl-s\">\"whale\"</span>)</pre></div>\n<p>The output shows us the 25\
    \ characters on either side of the word \"whale\" in <em>Moby Dick</em>. Let's\
    \ try this with another word, \"love.\" Just replace the word \"whale\" with \"\
    love,\" and we get the contexts in which Melville uses \"love\" in <em>Moby Dick</em>.\
    \ <code>concordance</code> is used (behind the scenes) for several other functions,\
    \ including <code>similar</code> and <code>common_contexts</code>.</p>\n<p>Let's\
    \ now see which words appear in similar contexts as the word \"love.\" NLTK has\
    \ a built-in function for this as well: <code>similar</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"\
    highlight highlight-source-python\"><pre><span class=\"pl-s1\">text1</span>.<span\
    \ class=\"pl-en\">similar</span>(<span class=\"pl-s\">\"love\"</span>)</pre></div>\n\
    <p>Behind the scenes, Python found all the contexts where the word \"love\" appears.\
    \ It also finds similar environments, and then what words were common among the\
    \ similar contexts. This gives a sense of what other words appear in similar contexts.\
    \ This is somewhat interesting in itself, but more interesting if we compare it\
    \ to something else. Let's take a look at another text. What about <em>Sense and\
    \ Sensibility</em> (<code>text2</code>)? Let's see what words are similar to \"\
    love\" in Jane Austen's writing. In the next cell, type:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\
    \ highlight-source-python\"><pre><span class=\"pl-s1\">text2</span>.<span class=\"\
    pl-en\">similar</span>(<span class=\"pl-s\">\"love\"</span>)</pre></div>\n<p>We\
    \ can compare the two and see immediately that Melville and Austen use the word\
    \ \"love\" differently.</p>\n<h2>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"\
    #investigating-lol\" id=\"user-content-investigating-lol\"><span aria-hidden=\"\
    true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Investigating \"lol\"</h2>\n\
    <p>Let's expand from novels for a minute and take a look at the NLTK Chat Corpus.\
    \ In chats, text messages, and other digital communication platforms, \"lol\"\
    \ is exceedingly common. We know it doesn't simply mean \"laughing out loud\"\u2014\
    maybe the <code>similar</code> function can provide some insight into what it\
    \ does mean.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-python\"><pre><span\
    \ class=\"pl-s1\">text5</span>.<span class=\"pl-en\">similar</span>(<span class=\"\
    pl-s\">\"lol\"</span>)</pre></div>\n<p>The resulting list is a lot of greetings,\
    \ indicating that \"lol\" probably has more of a <a href=\"https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100321840\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">phatic function</a>. Phatic language is language\
    \ primarily for communicating social closeness. Phatic words stand in contrast\
    \ to semantic words, which contribute meaning to the utterance.</p>\n<p>If you\
    \ are interested in this type of analysis, take a look at the <code>common_contexts</code>\
    \ function in the <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/book/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"\

  title: Searching for Words

- challenge: '<p>Try this with <code>text2</code>, <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>,
    <a href="#downloading-the-corpus">as we saw here</a>. Some relevant words are
    "marriage," "love," "home," "mother," "husband," "sister," and "wife." Pick a

    a few at a time. (Note that the comma in our writing here is <em>inside</em> the

  solution_title: ''
  text: "<p>We will now turn our attention away from the NLTK library and work with\
    \ our text using the <em>built-in Python functions</em>, the ones that come included\
    \ with the Python language, rather than the NLTK library. (This difference is\
    \ relevant because built-in python functions will work with any list of strings,\
    \ while some of the functions that are specific to the NLTK library will require\
    \ you to make your text \"nltk ready\". Don't worry about that now, we will show\
    \ you how to do it later in this workshop).</p>\n<p>First, let's find out how\
    \ many times a given word appears in the corpus. In this case (and all cases going\
    \ forward), our text will be treated as a list of words. Therefore, we will use\
    \ the <code>count</code> function. We could just as easily do this with a text\
    \ editor, but performing this in Python allows us to save it to a variable and\
    \ then utilize this statistic in other calculations (for example, if we want to\
    \ know what percentage of words in a corpus are 'lol', we would need a count of\
    \ the 'lol's). In the next cell, type:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-python\"\
    ><pre><span class=\"pl-s1\">text1</span>.<span class=\"pl-en\">count</span>(<span\
    \ class=\"pl-s\">\"whale\"</span>)</pre></div>\n<p>We see that \"whale\" occurs\
    \ 906 times, but that seems a little low. Let's check the same thing, but now\
    \ for \"Whale\" and \"WHALE\":</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-python\"\
    ><pre><span class=\"pl-s1\">text1</span>.<span class=\"pl-en\">count</span>(<span\
    \ class=\"pl-s\">\"Whale\"</span>)</pre></div>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-python\"\
    ><pre><span class=\"pl-s1\">text1</span>.<span class=\"pl-en\">count</span>(<span\
    \ class=\"pl-s\">\"WHALE\"</span>)</pre></div>\n<p>What is clear here is that\
    \ the <code>count</code> method is case-sensitive.\n\"Whale\" with a capital \"\
    W\" appears 282 times, and \"WHALE\" another 38 times. Depending on the type of\
    \ analysis, this distinction can be a problem, and we might want \"whale\", \"\
    Whale\" and \"WHALE\" to be collapsed into one single word. We will deal with\
    \ that in a moment. For the time being, we will accept that we have three different\
    \ entries for \"whale.\"</p>\n<p>This gets at a distinction between <strong>type</strong>\
    \ and <strong>token</strong>. \"Whale\" and \"whale\" are different types (as\
    \ of now) because they do not match identically. Every instance of \"whale\" in\
    \ the corpus is another <strong>token</strong>\u2014it is an instance of the type,\
    \ \"whale.\" Therefore, there are 906 tokens of \"whale\" in our corpus, 282 tokens\
    \ of \"Whale\" and 38 tokens of \"WHALE\".</p>\n<p>But that's not what we want.\
    \ Let's fix this by making all of the words lowercase. We will make a new list\
    \ of words, and call it <code>text1_tokens</code>. We will fill this list with\
    \ all the words in <code>text1</code>, but in their lowercase form. Python has\
    \ a built-in function, <code>lower()</code> that takes all letters and makes them\
    \ lowercase. In this same step, we are going to do a kind of tricky move, and\
    \ only keep the words that are alphabetical and pass over anything that is punctuation\
    \ or numbers. There is a built-in function, <code>isalpha()</code>, that will\
    \ allow us to save only those words that are made of letters. If <code>isalpha()</code>\
    \ is true, we'll make the word lowercase, and keep the word. If not, we'll pass\
    \ over it and move to the next one.</p>\n<p>Type the following code into a new\
    \ cell in your notebook. Pay special attention to the indentation, which must\
    \ appear as below. (Note that in Jupyter Notebook, indentation usually comes automatically.\
    \ If not, make sure to type the <kbd>space</kbd> key 4 times)</p>\n<div class=\"\

  - answers:
      correct:
      - The <code>len</code> method returns the length of the input, which can mean
        different things depending on its type. If it is a string, it will return
        the number of characters; if it is a list or dictionary, it will return the
        number of items.
      - Comparing the lexical density between texts of different sizes can give a
        problematic result. A possible solution is to use list slice and compare parts
        of both texts of a similar size.
      incorrect:
      - The lexical density measures the number of unique words per total word, and
        it is an objective measure of writing quality.

  text: "<p>Thus far, we have been asking questions that take stop words and grammatical\

    \ our words, i.e. \"jumping\" and \"jumps\" become \"jump.\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We\
    \ already completed step one, and are now working with our <code>text1_tokens</code>.\
    \ Remember, this variable, <code>text1_tokens</code>, contains a list of strings\
    \ that we will work with. We want to remove the stop words from that list. The\
    \ NLTK library comes with fairly comprehensive lists of stop words for many languages.\
    \ Stop words are function words that contribute very little semantic meaning and\
    \ most often have grammatical functions. Usually, these are function words such\
    \ as determiners, prepositions, auxiliaries, and others.</p>\n<p>To use NLTK's\
    \ stop words, we need to import the list of words from the corpus. (We could have\
    \ done this at the beginning of our program, and in more fully developed code,\
    \ we would put it up there, but this works, too.) In the next cell, type:</p>\n\

    \ it from our list. Otherwise, we want it to skip it. (The code below is slow,\

  text: "<p>Now that we've removed the stop words from our corpus, the next step is\
    \ to stem or lemmatize the remaining words. This means that we will strip off\
    \ the grammatical structure from the words. For example, <code>cats \u2B62 cat</code>,\
    \ and <code>walked \u2B62 walk</code>. If that was all we had to do, we could\
    \ stem the corpus and achieve the correct result, because stemming (as the name\
    \ implies) really just means cutting off affixes to find the root (or the stem).\
    \ Very quickly, however, this gets complicated, such as in the case of <code>men\
    \ \u2B62 man</code> and <code>sang \u2B62 sing</code>. Lemmatization deals with\
    \ this by looking up the word in a reference and finding the appropriate root\
    \ (though note that this still is not entirely accurate). Lemmatization, therefore,\
    \ takes a relatively long time, since each word must be looked up in a reference.\
    \ NLTK comes with pre-built stemmers and lemmatizers.</p>\n<p>We will use the\
    \ WordNet Lemmatizer from the NLTK Stem library, so let's import that now:</p>\n\

    <p>Because of the way that it is written \"under the hood,\" an instance of the\

    \ Clean List Contents</h2>\n<p>Let's check now to see the length of our final,\

    \ everything went right, you should have the same length as before, but a smaller\
    \ number of unique words. That makes sense since we did not remove any word, we\
    \ only changed some of them.</p>\n<p>Now if we were to calculate lexical density,\
    \ we would be looking at how many word stems with semantic content are represented\
    \ in <em>Moby Dick</em>, which is a different question than the one in our first\
    \ analysis of lexical density.</p>\n<p>Why don't you try that by yourself? Try\
    \ to remember how to calculate lexical density without looking back first. It\
    \ is ok if you have forgotten.</p>\n<p>Now let's have a look at the words Melville\
    \ uses in <em>Moby Dick</em>. We'd like to look at all of the <em>types</em>,\
    \ but not necessarily all of the <em>tokens.</em> We will order this set so that\
    \ it is in an order we can handle. In the next cell, type:</p>\n<div class=\"\
    highlight highlight-source-python\"><pre><span class=\"pl-en\">sorted</span>(<span\
    \ class=\"pl-en\">set</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">text1_clean</span>))[:<span\
    \ class=\"pl-c1\">30</span>]</pre></div>\n<p><code>sorted</code> combined with\
    \ <code>set</code> should give us a list of all the unique words in <em>Moby Dick</em>\
    \ in alphabetical order, but we only want to see the first ones. Notice how there\
    \ are some words we wouldn't have expected, such as 'abandon', 'abandoned', 'abandonedly',\
    \ and 'abandonment'. This process is far from perfect, but it is useful. However,\
    \ depending on your goal, a different process, like <em>stemming</em> might be\
    \ better.</p>"

  text: "<p>Now that we have seen and implemented a series of text analysis techniques,\
    \ let's go to the Internet to find a new text. You could use something such as\
    \ historic newspapers, or Supreme Court proceedings, or use any txt file on your\
    \ computer. Here we will use <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\
    \ target=\"_blank\">Project Gutenberg</a>. Project Gutenberg is an archive of\
    \ public domain written works, available in a wide variety of formats, including\
    \ <code>.txt</code>. You can download these to your computer or access them via\

    \ (see <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/996/996-0.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\"\
    \ target=\"_blank\">here</a>), and will work with that.</p>\n<p>The Python package\
    \ <code>urllib</code> comes installed with Python, but is inactive by default,\
    \ so we still need to import it to utilize the functions. Since we are only going\
    \ to use the urlopen function, we will just import that one.</p>\n<p>In the next\

    \ program to interact with files on the internet by opening them. It does not\
    \ read them, however\u2014they are just available to be read in the next line.\
    \ This is the default behavior any time a file is opened and read by Python. One\
    \ reason is that you might want to read a file in different ways. For example,\
    \ if you have a <em>really</em> big file\u2014think big data\u2014you might want\
    \ to read line-by-line rather than the whole thing at once.</p>\n<p>Now let's\
    \ specify which URL we are going to use. Though you might be able to find <em>Don\
    \ Quixote</em> in the Project Gutenberg files, please type this in so that we\
    \ are all using the same format (there are multiple <code>.txt</code> files on\
    \ the site, one with utf-8 encoding, another with ascii encoding). We want the\
    \ utf-8 encoded one. The difference between these is beyond the scope of this\
    \ tutorial, but you can check out this <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding\"\

  solution_title: ''
  text: "<p><em>Note that we are going to use the pre-cleaned, <code>dq_text</code>\
    \ object for this section.</em></p>\n<p>POS (Part-of-Speech) tagging is going\
    \ through a text and identifying which part of speech each word belongs to (i.e.,\
    \ Noun, Verb, or Adjective). Every word belongs to a part of speech, but some\
    \ words can be confusing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Floyd is happy.</li>\n<li>Happy is a\
    \ state of being.</li>\n<li>Happy has five letters.</li>\n<li>I'm going to Happy\
    \ Cat tonight.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore, part of speech is as much related to\
    \ the word itself as its relationship to the words around it. A good part-of-speech\
    \ tagger takes this into account, but there are some impossible cases as well:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>Wanda was entertaining last night.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Part of Speech tagging\
    \ can be done very simply: with a very small <em>tag set</em>, or in a very complex\
    \ way: with a much more elaborate tag set. We are going to implement a compromise,\
    \ and use a neither small nor large tag set, the <a href=\"https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Penn Tree Bank POS Tag Set</a>.</p>\n<p>This\
    \ is the tag set that is pre-loaded into NLTK. When we call the tagger, we expect\
    \ it to return an object with the word and the tag associated. Because POS tagging\
    \ is dependent upon the stop words, we have to use a text that includes the stop\
    \ words. Therefore, we will go back to using the <code>dq_text</code> object for\
    \ this section. Let's try it out. Type:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-python\"\
    ><pre><span class=\"pl-s1\">dq_tagged</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span\
    \ class=\"pl-s1\">nltk</span>.<span class=\"pl-en\">pos_tag</span>(<span class=\"\
    pl-s1\">dq_text</span>)</pre></div>\n<p>Let's inspect what we have:</p>\n<div\
    \ class=\"highlight highlight-source-python\"><pre><span class=\"pl-en\">print</span>(<span\
    \ class=\"pl-s1\">dq_tagged</span>[:<span class=\"pl-c1\">10</span>])</pre></div>\n\
    <p>This is a list of ordered <em>tuples</em>. The Python native type <em>tuple</em>\
    \ is similar to a list, but can't be changed once it is created. They are also\
    \ denoted with parentheses, rather than square brackets. Each element in the list\
    \ is a tuple\u2014or a pairing\u2014consisting of <code>(word, POS-tag)</code>.\
    \ This is great, but it is very detailed. I would like to know how many nouns,\
    \ verbs, and adjectives I have.</p>\n<p>First, I'll make an empty dictionary to\
    \ hold my results. (If you don't know what a dictionary is and how they work,\
    \ you can check a quick explanation <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-dicts/\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.) After that, I will go through\
    \ this list of tuples and count the number of times each tag appears. Every time\
    \ I encounter a new tag, I'll add it to a dictionary and then increment by one\
    \ every time I encounter that tag again. Let's see what that looks like in code:</p>\n\
    <div class=\"highlight highlight-source-python\"><pre><span class=\"pl-s1\">tag_dict</span>\

  intro: '<p>Congratulations! You are done with the Text Analysis workshop!

    As you may expect, this course was only the beginning of your jorney. NLTK is
    a vast and ever expanding world. The possibilies are numerous, with exciting new
    things coming everyday.

    Our goal was to show some of those possibilities, and equip you with enough tools/knowledge/skills
    to be able to keep advancing. In this page we suggest you further readings and
    other tutorials for which we feel you might be ready. Don''t be afraid to try!
    It is also useful to come back to this workshop with fresh eyes after a while.
    It will help you solidify some of the knowledge and make some things more clear.

    Have a happy journey!</p>'
