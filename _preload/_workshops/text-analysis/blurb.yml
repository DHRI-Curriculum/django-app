text: I started learning Python not long ago. At first, I was trying to learn how
  to do quantitative analysis without spending lots of money on proprietary software
  (Good bye, SPSS!). I found out about the Python Users' Group and started coming
  for their meetings. I immediately got amazed by their willingness to help me as
  a complete newbie who had no idea what was doing. One thing led to another, and
  I became a Digital Fellow! Now, I am the one excited to help beginners learn Python.<br
  /><br />The next step was to learn to do text-analysis, which I knew had incredible
  tools for academic research. My first step was to take this very workshop you have
  in front of you! (I mean, an older version of it). I redid it a couple times to
  feel confident. Later, I took a course in the Digital Humanities Summer Institute.
  Since then, I've been teaching text analysis workshops, and using it on personal
  projects. I don't feel like an expert by any means, and that is not me being humble.
  There is just so much out there to learn, some of which is very complex and complicated.
  However, I feel confident that I now know enough to be able to find and learn things
  by myself, and that is exactly where I want all my students to be.
