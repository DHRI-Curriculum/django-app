text: "My first memories of using the command line date back to 1994, when my older\
  \ brother first introduced me to a Windows computer. I was seven years old and beside\
  \ learning a few commands to run some maintenance utilities, my relationship with\
  \ the command line didn\u2019t progress very much at all until my days as a graduate\
  \ student. In January 2018, I refreshed my memory through a workshop at the GCDI\
  \ Digital Research Institute, before having the opportunity (and the need) to apply\
  \ my newly learned skills to interact with a web server to install Omeka for the\
  \ East Bay Punk Digital Archive. I now regularly use the command line to manage\
  \ the installation of server-side software applications, plugins, and tools."
