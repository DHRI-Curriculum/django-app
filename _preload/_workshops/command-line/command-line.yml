  abstract: 'If asked to show someone who has never seen a computer how to *do* something
    on your computer, many of us would explain what a screen and a cursor are, and
    then show how to point and click on icons. This approach relies on a graphical
    user interface, or GUI (pronounced "gooey!"). Today we''re going to explore another
    way to make your computer do things: through the command line. Instead of pointing
    and clicking, we''ll be typing in either git bash (Windows) or terminal (macOS)
    to tell the computer directly what task we''d like it to perform.'

  - <p>Learn commands to create directories (<code>mkdir</code>)</p>
  - <p>Navigate our file structure using change directory (<code>cd</code>), print
    working directory (<code>pwd</code>), and list (<code>ls</code>)</p>
  - <p>Move content from one place to another using redirects (<code>&gt;</code>)
    and pipes (<code>|</code>)</p>
  - <p>Explore a comma separated values (.csv) dataset using word and line counts,
    <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>, and the concatenate command <code>cat</code></p>
  - <p>Search text files using the <code>grep</code> command</p>
  - <p>Create and sort cheat sheets for the commands we learn</p>
  projects:
  - annotation: Most Python- and R-based projects will require you to have some knowledge
      of the command line. At a very basic level, you will be invoking a Python script
      and will be using values of command line arguments when creating and running
      your scripts.

  - annotation: The command line is also useful for setting up installations of server
      side software like [Omeka](www.omeka.org). The command line will allow you to
      navigate the file structure of your server. Commands like ls, mkdir, rmdir,
      cd, etc. are really important. For example, grep could help you find a plugin
      directory that you might have accidentally placed in the wrong location.

  text: '<p>The command line is a text-based way of interacting with your computer.
    You may hear it called different names, such as the terminal, the shell, or bash.
    In practice, you can use these terms interchangeably. (If you''re curious, though,
    you can read more about them <a href="/glossary/term/command-line/">in the glossary</a>.)
    The shell we use (whether terminal, shell, or bash) is a program that accepts
    commands as text input and converts commands into appropriate operating system
    functions.</p>

    <p>The command line (of computers today) receives these commands as text that
    is typed in.</p>

    <h2>

    <a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#what-does-text-based-mean" id="user-content-what-does-text-based-mean"><span
    aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Does "Text-based"
    Mean?</h2>

    <p>For those of us comfortable reading and writing, the idea of "text-based" in
    the context of computers can seem a bit strange. As we start to get comfortable
    typing commands to the computer, it''s important to distinguish "text" from word
    processed, desktop publishing. In the latter case, we use software (think Microsoft
    Word or Google Docs) that displays what we want to produce without showing us
    the code the computer is reading to render the formatting. On the other hand,
    while less pretty to look at, plain text has the advantage of being manipulable
    in different contexts.</p>

    <p>Let''s take a quick moment to discuss text and text editors.</p>'

  questions:
  - answers:
      correct:
      - Plain text contains no formatting, only line breaks and spacing.
      - Rich text is styled text, <em>i.e.,</em> plain text completed by information
        such as font size, format, and colors.
      incorrect:
      - Plain text cannot be marked up.
      - One can't determine whether there is a difference betweeen the two without
        looking at their content.

    \ or any of the fields <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Greetham_(textual_scholar)\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">David Greetham</a> lays out in <em>Textual\
    \ Scholarship</em>, \"text\" has its specific meanings. As scholars working with\
    \ computers, we need to be aware of the ways plain text and formatted text differ.\
    \ Words on a screen may have hidden formatting. Many of us learned to use a word\
    \ processor like Microsoft Word and don't realize how much is going on behind\
    \ the words shown on the screen. For the purposes of communicating with the computer\
    \ and for easier movement between different programs, we need to use text without\
    \ hidden formatting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/static/website/images/lessons/command-line/worddoc.png\"\

    true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Plain Text</h2>\n<p>For the purposes\
    \ of communicating with machines and between machines, we need characters to be\
    \ as flexible as possible. Plain text include characters of readable material\
    \ but not graphical representation.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.1.0/\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Unicode Standard</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n\
    <p>Plain text is a pure sequence of character codes; plain Unicode-encoded text\
    \ is therefore a sequence of Unicode character codes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Plain\
    \ text shows its cards\u2014if it's marked up, the markup will be human readable.\
    \ Plain text can be moved between programs more fluidly and can respond to programmatic\
    \ manipulations. Because it is not tied to a particular font or color or placement,\
    \ plain text can be styled externally.</p>\n<p>A counterpoint to plain text is\
    \ rich text (sometimes denoted by the Microsoft rich text format <code>.rtf</code>\
    \ file extension) or \"enriched text\" (sometimes seen as an option in email programs).\
    \ In rich text files, plain text is elaborated with formatting specific to the\
    \ program in which they are made.</p>\n<p>Plain text has two main properties in\
    \ regard to rich text:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>plain text is the underlying content\
    \ stream to which formatting can be applied. Plain text is public, standardized,\
    \ and universally readable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\"\

    \ a Text Editor</h2>\n<p>An important tool for programming and working in the\
    \ command line is a text editor. A text editor is a program that allows you to\
    \ edit plain text files, such as <code>.txt</code>, <code>.csv</code>, or <code>.md</code>.\
    \ Text editors are not used to edit rich text documents, such as <code>.docx</code>\
    \ or <code>.rtf</code>, and rich text editors should not be used to edit plain\
    \ text files. This is because rich text editors will add many invisible special\
    \ characters that will prevent programs from running and configuration files from\
    \ being read correctly.</p>\n<p>While it doesn't really matter which text editor\
    \ you choose, you should try to become comfortable with at least one text editor.</p>\n\
    <p>Choosing a text editor has as much to do with personality as it does with functionality.\
    \ Graphical user interfaces (GUIs), user options, and \"hackability\" vary from\
    \ program to program.</p>\n<h2>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"\

  text: '<p>Initially, for some of us, the command line can feel a bit unfamiliar.
    Why step away from a point-and-click workflow? By using the command line, we move
    into an environment where we have more minute control over each task we''d like
    the computer to perform. Instead of ordering your food in a restaurant, you''re
    stepping into the kitchen. It''s more work, but there are also more possibilities.</p>

    <p>The command line allows you to...</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Easily automate tasks such as creating, copying, and converting files.</li>

    <li>Set up your programming environment.</li>

    <li>Run programs you create.</li>

    <li>Access the (many) programs and utilities that do not have graphical equivalents.</li>

    <li>Control other computers remotely.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>In addition to being a useful tool in itself, the command line gives you access
    to a second set of programs and utilities and is a complement to learning programming.</p>

    <p>What if all these cool possibilities seem a bit abstract to you right now?
    That''s alright! On a very basic level, most uses of the command line are about
    <strong>showing information</strong> that the computer has, or <strong>modifying
    or making</strong> things (files, programs, etc.) on the computer.</p>

    \ Line: Folders</h2>\n<p>OK, we're going to try another command. But first, let's\
    \ make sure we understand some things about how your computer's filesystem works.</p>\n\
    <p>Your computer's files are organized in what's known as a hierarchical filesystem.\
    \ That means there's a top level or <code>root</code> folder on your system. That\
    \ folder has other folders in it, and those folders have folders in them, and\
    \ so on. You can draw these relationships in a tree:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/static/website/images/lessons/command-line/hierarchical-filesystem-example.png\"\
    \ rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"An example of how a\
    \ hierarchical filesystem looks\" class=\"img-fluid d-block my-4\" src=\"/static/website/images/lessons/command-line/hierarchical-filesystem-example.png\"\
    \ style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></a></p>\n<p>The root or highest-level folder on\
    \ macOS is just called <code>/</code>. We won't need to go in there, though, since\
    \ that's mostly just files for the operating system. On Windows, the root directory\
    \ is usually called <code>C:</code>. (If you are curious why <code>C:</code> is\
    \ the default name on Windows, you can read about it <a href=\"http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2015/04/c-drive-default-windows-based-computers-2\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p>Note that we are using\
    \ the word \"directory\" interchangeably with \"folder\"\u2014they both refer\
    \ to the same thing.</p>\n<p>OK, let's try a command that tells us where we are\
    \ in the filesystem:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-text-shell-session\"\
    ><pre>$ <span class=\"pl-s1\"><span class=\"pl-c1\">pwd</span></span></pre></div>\n\
    <p>You should get output like <code>/Users/your-username</code>. That means you're\
    \ in the <code>your-username</code> directory in the <code>Users</code> folder\
    \ inside the <code>/</code> or root directory. This directory is often called\
    \ the \"home\" directory.</p>\n<p>On Windows, your output would instead be <code>C:/Users/your-username</code>.\
    \ The folder you're in is called the working directory, and <code>pwd</code> stands\
    \ for \"print working directory.\" \"Print\" as a word can be somewhat misleading.\
    \ The command <code>pwd</code> won't actually print anything except on your screen.\
    \ This command is easier to grasp when we interpret \"print\" as \"display.\"\
    </p>\n<p>Now we know \"where\" we are. But what if we want to know what files\
    \ and folders are in the <code>your-username</code> directory, a.k.a. the working\
    \ directory? Try entering:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-text-shell-session\"\
    ><pre>$ <span class=\"pl-s1\">ls</span></pre></div>\n<p>You should see a number\
    \ of folders, probably including <code>Documents</code>, <code>Desktop</code>,\
    \ and so on. You may also see some files. These are the contents of the current\
    \ working directory. <code>ls</code> will \"list\" the contents of the directory\
    \ you are in.</p>\n<p>Wonder what's in the <code>Desktop</code> folder? Let's\
    \ try navigating to it with the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\
    \ highlight-text-shell-session\"><pre>$ <span class=\"pl-s1\"><span class=\"pl-c1\"\
    >cd</span> Desktop</span></pre></div>\n<p>The <code>cd</code> command lets us\
    \ \"change directory.\" (Make sure the \"D\" in \"Desktop\" is capitalized.) If\
    \ the command was successful, you won't see any output. This is normal\u2014often,\
    \ the command line will succeed silently.</p>\n<p>So how do we know it worked?\
    \ That's right, let's use our <code>pwd</code> command again. We should get:</p>\n\
    <div class=\"highlight highlight-text-shell-session\"><pre>$ <span class=\"pl-s1\"\
    ><span class=\"pl-c1\">pwd</span></span>\n<span class=\"pl-c1\">/Users/your-username/Desktop</span></pre></div>\n\
    <p>Now try <code>ls</code> again to see what's on your desktop. These three commands\u2014\
    <code>pwd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>cd</code>\u2014are the most commonly\
    \ used in the terminal. Between them, you can orient yourself and move around.</p>\n\

    \ id=\"user-content-compare-with-the-gui\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"\
    octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Compare with the GUI</h3>\n<p>It's important\
    \ to note that this is the same old information you can get by pointing and clicking\
    \ displayed to you in a different way.</p>\n<p>Go ahead and use pointing and clicking\
    \ to navigate to your working directory\u2014you can get there a few ways, but\
    \ try starting from \"My Computer\" and clicking down from there. You'll notice\
    \ that the folder names should match the ones that the command line spits out\
    \ for you, since it's the same information! We're just using a different mode\

    <div class=\"highlight highlight-text-shell-session\"><pre>$ <span class=\"pl-s1\"\
    >mkdir projects</span></pre></div>\n<p>Now run <code>ls</code> to see if a projects\

  text: '<p>So far, you''ve learned a number of commands and one special symbol, the
    <code>&gt;</code> or redirect. Now we''re going to learn another, the <code>|</code>
    or "pipe."</p>

    <p>Pipes let you take the output of one command and use it as the input for another.</p>

    <p>Let''s start with a simple example:</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-text-shell-session"><pre>$ <span class="pl-s1"><span
    class="pl-c1">echo</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Hello

    wc -w</span>

    <span class="pl-c1">5</span></pre></div>

    <p>In this example, we take the output of the <code>echo</code> command ("Hello
    from the command line") and pipe it to the <code>wc</code> or word count command,
    adding a flag <code>-w</code> for number of words. The result is the number of
    words in the text that we entered. Flags marked with hyphens, such as <code>-l</code>
    or <code>-m</code>, indicate options which belong to specific commands.</p>

    <p>Let''s try another. What if we wanted to put the commands in our cheat sheet
    in alphabetical order?</p>

    <p>Use <code>pwd</code> and <code>cd</code> to make sure you''re in the folder
    with your cheat sheet. Then try:</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-text-shell-session"><pre>$ <span class="pl-s1">cat
    cheat-sheet.txt <span class="pl-k">|</span> sort</span></pre></div>

    <p>You should see the contents of the cheat sheet file with each line rearranged
    in alphabetical order. If you wanted to save this output, you could use a <code>&gt;</code>
    to print the output to a file, like this:</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-text-shell-session"><pre>$ <span class="pl-s1">cat

  text: "<p>So far the only text file we've been working with is our cheat sheet.\
    \ Now, this is where the command line can be a very powerful tool: let's try working\
    \ with a large text file, one that would be too large to work with by hand.</p>\n\
    <p>Let's download the data we're going to work with:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/command-line/raw/v2.0/files/nypl_items.csv\"\
    >Download <code>nypl_items.csv</code></a></p>\n<p>Our data set is a list of public\
    \ domain items from the New York Public Library. It's in <code>.csv</code> format,\
    \ which is a plain text spreadsheet format. CSV stands for \"comma separated values,\"\
    \ and each field in the spreadsheet is separated with a comma. It's all still\
    \ plain text, though, so we can manipulate the data using the command line.</p>\n\
    <h2>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#move-command\" id=\"user-content-move-command\"\
    ><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Move Command</h2>\n\
    <p>Once the file is downloaded, move it from your <code>Downloads</code> folder\
    \ to the <code>projects</code> folder on your desktop\u2014either through the\
    \ command line, or drag and drop in the GUI. Since this is indeed a command line\
    \ workshop, you should try the former!</p>\n<p>To move this file using the command\
    \ line, you first need to navigate to your <code>Downloads</code> folder where\
    \ that file is saved. Then type the <code>mv</code> command followed by the name\
    \ of the file you want to move and then the file path to your <code>projects</code>\
    \ folder on your desktop, which is where you want to move that file to (note that\
    \ <code>~</code> refers to your home folder):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-text-shell-session\"\
    ><pre>$ <span class=\"pl-s1\">mv nypl_items.csv <span class=\"pl-k\">~</span>/Desktop/projects/</span></pre></div>\n\
    <p>You can then navigate to that <code>projects</code> folder and use the <code>ls</code>\
    \ command to check that the file is now there.</p>\n<h2>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\"\
    \ class=\"anchor\" href=\"#viewing-data-in-the-command-line\" id=\"user-content-viewing-data-in-the-command-line\"\
    ><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Viewing\
    \ Data in the Command Line</h2>\n<p>Try using <code>cat</code> to look at the\
    \ data. You'll find it all goes by too fast to get any sense of it. (You can click\
    \ <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> on your keyboard to cancel the output if it's\
    \ taking too long.)</p>\n<p>Instead, let's use another tool, the <code>less</code>\
    \ command, to get the data one page at a time:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-text-shell-session\"\
    ><pre>$ <span class=\"pl-s1\">less nypl_items.csv</span>\n<span class=\"pl-c1\"\
    >...</span></pre></div>\n<p><code>less</code> gives you a paginated view of the\
    \ data; it will show you contents of a file or the output from a command or string\
    \ of commands, page by page.</p>\n<p>To view the file contents page by page, you\
    \ may use the following keyboard shortcuts (that should work on Windows using\
    \ Git Bash or on macOS terminal):</p>\n<p>Click the <kbd>f</kbd> key to view forward\
    \ one page, or the <kbd>b</kbd> key to view back one page.</p>\n<p>Once you're\
    \ done, click the <kbd>q</kbd> key to return to the command line.</p>\n<p>Let's\
    \ try two more commands for viewing the contents of a file:</p>\n<div class=\"\
    highlight highlight-text-shell-session\"><pre>$ <span class=\"pl-s1\">head nypl_items.csv</span>\n\
    <span class=\"pl-c1\">...</span>\n$ <span class=\"pl-s1\">tail nypl_items.csv</span>\n\
    <span class=\"pl-c1\">...</span></pre></div>\n<p>These commands print out the\
    \ very first (the \"head\") and very last (the \"tail\") sections of the file,\
    \ respectively.</p>\n<h2>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#cleaning-the-data\"\
    \ id=\"user-content-cleaning-the-data\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon\
    \ octicon-link\"></span></a>Cleaning the Data</h2>\n<p>We didn't tell you this\
    \ before, but there are duplicate lines in our data! Two, to be exact. Before\
    \ we try removing them, let's see how many entries are in our <code>.csv</code>\
    \ file:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-text-shell-session\"><pre>$ <span\
    \ class=\"pl-s1\">cat nypl_items.csv <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> wc -l</span>\n\
    <span class=\"pl-c1\">100001</span></pre></div>\n<p>This tells us there are 100,001\
    \ lines in our file. The <code>wc</code> tool stands for \"word count,\" but it\
    \ can also count characters and lines in a file. We tell <code>wc</code> to count\
    \ lines by using the <code>-l</code> flag. If we wanted to count characters, we\
    \ could use <code>wc -m</code>.</p>\n<p>To find and remove duplicate lines, we\
    \ can use the <code>uniq</code> command. Let's try it out:</p>\n<div class=\"\
    highlight highlight-text-shell-session\"><pre>$ <span class=\"pl-s1\">cat nypl_items.csv\
    \ <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> uniq <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> wc -l</span>\n\
    <span class=\"pl-c1\">99999</span></pre></div>\n<p>OK, the count went down by\
    \ two because the <code>uniq</code> command removed the duplicate lines. But which\
    \ lines were duplicated?</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-text-shell-session\"\
    ><pre>$ <span class=\"pl-s1\">cat nypl_items.csv <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span>\
    \ uniq -d</span>\n<span class=\"pl-c1\">...</span></pre></div>\n<p>The <code>uniq</code>\
    \ command with the <code>-d</code> flag prints out the lines that have duplicates.</p>"

  questions:
  - answers:
      correct:
      - It searches the given file for lines containing a match to the given strings
        or words.
      - It can be combined with other commands, so as to produce a search that matches
        their output.
      incorrect:
      - It produces a new file with the lines containing the strings or words you
        are searching.
      - It delete the strings or words you are searching from a file.
    question: Let's think about the <code>grep</code> command.
  solution: <p>If you want to get a little more milage out of the <code>grep</code>
    command, refer to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/using-grep-regular-expressions-to-search-for-text-patterns-in-linux"
    rel="nofollow">this tutorial on grep and regular expressions</a>. Regular expressions
    (or regex) provide methods to search for text in more advanced ways, including
    specific wildcards, matching ranges of characters such as letters and numbers,
    and detecting features such as the beginning and end of lines. If you want to
    experiment with regular expressions in an easy-to-use environment, numerous regex
    test interfaces are available from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?w&amp;q=regex+tester"
    rel="nofollow">a simple google search</a>, such as <a href="https://regexr.com/"

  text: '<p>So we''ve cleaned our data set, but how do we find entries that use a
    particular term?</p>

    <p>Let''s say I want to find all the entries in our data set that use the term
    "Paris."</p>

    <p>Here we can use the <code>grep</code> command. <code>grep</code> stands for
    "global regular expression print." The <code>grep</code> command processes text
    line by line and prints any lines which match a specified pattern. Regular expressions
    are special strings representing a pattern to be matched in a search operation.
    <code>grep</code> gives us access to the power of regular expressions as we search
    for text.</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-text-shell-session"><pre>$ <span class="pl-s1">cat
    nypl_items.csv <span class="pl-k">|</span> grep -i <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>paris<span
    class="pl-pds">"</span></span></span>

    <span class="pl-c1">...</span></pre></div>

    <p>This will print out all the lines that contain the word "Paris." (The <code>-i</code>
    flag makes the command ignore capitalization.) Let''s use our <code>wc -l</code>
    command to see how many lines that is:</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-text-shell-session"><pre>$ <span class="pl-s1">cat
    nypl_items.csv <span class="pl-k">|</span> grep -i <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>paris<span
    class="pl-pds">"</span></span> <span class="pl-k">|</span> wc -l</span>

    <span class="pl-c1">191</span></pre></div>

    <p>Here we have asked <code>cat</code> to read <code>nypl_items.csv</code>, take
    the output and pipe it into the <code>grep -i</code> command, which will ignore
    capitalization and find all instances of the word <code>paris</code>. We then
    take the output of that <code>grep</code> command and pipe it into the word count
    <code>wc</code> command with the <code>-l</code> lines option. The pipeline returns
    <code>191</code> letting us know that "Paris" (or "paris") occurs on 191 lines
    of our data set.</p>'

  intro: You've made it through your introduction to the command line! By now, you
    have experienced some of the power of communicating with your computer using text
    commands. The basic steps you learned today will help as you'll further your digital
    skills. For example, you might work with the command line interface to set up
    your [version control with git](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git) or you'll
    have your text editor open while [writing python scripts](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/python)
    or building basic websites with [HTML and CSS](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/html-css).
    Having a grasp of command line basics will not only make you more familiar with
    how your computer and basic programming work, but it will also give you access
    to tools and communities that will expand your research.
