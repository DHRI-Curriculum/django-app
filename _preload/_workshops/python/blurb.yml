text: As someone from a humanities and literary background, programming languages
  were not something I had interest in learning, let alone teaching. My entry into
  digital humanities began with an unexpected experience on a classroom project with
  TEI (a markup language similar to HTML), where I encoded a heavily revised manuscript
  into electronic format. With time and effort, I marked up each detail of the manuscript,
  and to my surprise, I was totally immersed in this close and careful work and in
  the production of a concrete piece of textual scholarship. I looked into more digital
  humanities tools, and eventually, I inherited this Python workshop from a former
  digital fellow. In learning Python, I rediscovered the satisfaction that comes with
  the slow progress of building toward something, of making a concrete thing, like
  a program that scrapes the web or cleans text. For someone who spends a lot of time
  discussing and writing about (and often getting carried away with) theory and criticism,
  learning languages like Python has been a nice reorientation toward the matter of
  my research, reminding me to focus on the text and my engagement with it as the
  ground for scholarship.
