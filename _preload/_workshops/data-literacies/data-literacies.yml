  - <p>Data and data analysis is <a href="https://medium.com/@angebassa/data-alone-isnt-ground-truth-9e733079dfd4"
    rel="nofollow">not free from bias</a>. There is no magic blackbox for which data
    emerges from and is contextually driven. As we think about the automation process
    of looking at "big" data, we have to be aware of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing"
    rel="nofollow">the biases that gets reproduced that is "hidden."</a></p>
  - <p>De-identified information can be <a href="https://techscience.org/a/2015092903/"
    rel="nofollow">reconstructed from piecemeal data</a> found across different sources.
    When we consider what we are doing with the data we have collected, we also need
    to think about the possible re-identification of our participants.</p>
  - <p>Big data projects often times requiring sharing data sets across different
    individuals and teams. In addition, to ensure that our work is reproducible and
    accountable, we may also feel inclined to share the data collected. As such, figuring
    out <a href="https://techscience.org/a/2015101601/" rel="nofollow">how to share
    such data</a> is crucial in the project planning stage.</p>
  learning_objectives:
  - <p>Know the stages of data analysis</p>
  - <p>Understand the difference between proprietary and open data formats</p>
  - <p>Become familiar with the specific requirements of "high quality data"</p>

  text: '<p>We begin without data. Then it is observed, or made, or imagined, or generated.
    After that, it goes through further transformations. Stages of data typically
    consist of a) collection of "raw" data, b) processing and/or transforming data,
    c) cleaning, d) analysis, and e) visualization. For example, we can consider the
    stages in the following way:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>We start with formulating a research question(s) or hypotheses and set up
    a project to answer our question(s).

    <ul>

    <li>E.g. What proportion of the artwork collected and/or hosted in the Met are
    by non cis-gender men artists and also in public domain?</li>

    </ul>

    </li>

    <li>In the process of setting up the project, we make decisions on what kind of
    data we think can help us to answer the question

    <ul>

    <li>E.g. I think I can get the data from the Met''s <a href="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/metmuseum/openaccess/master/MetObjects.csv"
    rel="nofollow" target="_blank">open access data set</a>. I will need to look at
    what variables exist in the dataset to find out if I can filter by gender and
    the variables that will correspond to copyrights.</li>

    </ul>

    </li>

    <li>After collecting our data we then consider and make decisions in the processes
    of cleaning.

    <ul>

    <li>E.g. I have to transform some of the gender values and decide what to do with
    the missing fields.</li>

    </ul>

    </li>

    <li>We then run our preliminary analysis of the data.

    <ul>

    <li>E.g. I can run an analysis of the subset of non cis-gender men and public
    domain media objects against the total number of media objects to find out the
    proportion.</li>

    </ul>

    </li>

    <li>At the end of our analysis, a decision is then made about how would we would
    present the data and its analysis.

    <ul>

    <li>E.g. I can present the result in a pie chart.</li>

    </ul>

    </li>

    </ul>

    <p>This is one cycle in which data goes from collection to transformation to visualization.
    This is also <em>not</em> the only way to go through the stages. For example,
    we could do a preliminary analysis first, such as running a correlation of variables,
    to explore what is missing before we begin the process of cleaning. Often, we
    also end up doing multiple iterations of cleaning and analysis, making decisions
    and choices to collapse particular variables or remove them entirely at each iterations.
    Making sure that we keep a clear documentation of our process will ensure that
    we are accountable to the data we have collected/are using and also ensure that
    our results can be replicated and reproduced if others choose to work on our "raw"
    data.</p>

    id="user-content-naming-conventions-for-directory-structures"><span aria-hidden="true"
    class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Naming Conventions for Directory Structures</h2>

    <p>Before beginning your data collection, manipulation, and transformation, a
    good practice is to determine your file naming conventions. How many times have
    named something as <code>XXX_FinalFINALFINAL.pdf</code> or have difficulty searching
    for a version of the file that contained all that good idea that was edited out
    in the <code>XXX_FinalFINALFINALFINAL.pdf</code> version? While tools like version
    controlling with git can be helpful, we can also begin with setting up file naming
    conventions that can help us succeed! Here''s an example from <a href="https://library.stanford.edu/research/data-management-services/case-studies/case-study-file-naming"
    rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stanford</a> that demonstrates the problems of
    badly name files in our projects.</p>

    <p>For example, The Graduate Center''s <a href="https://libguides.gc.cuny.edu/c.php?g=159618&amp;p=1045090"
    rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Data Management</a> guide suggest that top level
    folders (such as your main project folder) should include your project title,
    a unique identifier and the date (year) of your project (e.g. <code>dataliteracies_XYZ_2020</code>).
    Your sub folders and individual files should follow a similar system, with an
    identifiable activity or project in the file name (e.g. a sub-folder of the project:
    <code>sections_xyz_2020</code>, a file in the project: <code>lessons_XYZ_2020.doc</code>).</p>'
  title: Stages of Data
  workshop: data-literacies
- challenge: '<ol>

    <li>Do you think "big data" is "raw data"? Why or why not? Do quantity of data
    play into our assumptions of "rawness"?</li>

    <li>How should we approach data that we have "scraped"?</li>

    <li>How do you collect "raw" data? What are some of your practices? What are your
    field''s practices?</li>

    <li>If you have not done so, open up <code>moSmall.csv</code> from your local
    computer/laptop. As the original file has about 500,000 entries, we''ve taken
    a random sample of 1% of the <a href="https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess">original
    dataset</a>. In this case, would you consider this file to be a "raw" dataset?</li>

  questions:
  - answers:
      correct:
      - 'False'
      incorrect:
      - 'True'
    question: The stages of data is a single iteration process, i.e. there is a fixed
      stage progression from data collection to visualization.
  - answers:
      correct:
      - is data that is yet to be processed.
      - is data that is received and/or collected.
      incorrect:
      - is the same to every researcher/research team.
      - can only be collected from participants.
    question: 'Which of the following statements are true for "raw" data:'
  solution: '<ol>

    <li>I think big data can be raw data depending on how the data is obtained and
    the processes I need to take before I can apply an analysis. I think that with
    large datasets, I always assume "rawness" because I won''t need all of the variables
    or there will be decisions that need to be made about missing entries.</li>

    <li>I think my approach to scraped data is similar to big data.</li>

    <li>Currently I collect through either pushshift.io or scrap permissible social
    media sites on my own or with my collaborator (who will have appropriate authorship).
    I know that my field of psychology is guilty of the discussion on mechanical turk
    and also often rely on undergraduates for experimental data collection who would
    have to sign up for experiments for credits in class or do the labour of working
    in the lab for the promises of bettering their resume for grad school applications.</li>

    <li>The dataset is "raw" to me as I will likely be working on removing certain
    variables/entries to work towards my question.</li>

    </ol>'
  text: '<p>"Raw" data is yet to be processed, meaning it has yet to be manipulated
    by a human or computer. Received or collected data could be in any number of formats,
    locations, etc.. It could be in any of the forms listed in the previous section.</p>

    <p>But "raw" data is a relative term, inasmuch as when one person finishes processing
    data and presents it as a finished product, another person may take that product
    and work on it further, and for them that data is "raw" data. For example, I may
    consider the <a href="http://gss.norc.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">General
    Social Survey</a> data to be "raw" as it will require me to filter out missing
    entries and collapse variables or fields before I can run my analysis. A researcher
    who participated in the creation of this survey may not consider the version on
    the site as "raw" because the "raw" version is the physical paper copies of the
    file. As you can see, this consideration of what is "raw" is non-definitive and
    is dependent on the project you are working on and the narrative you want to tell
    with the results.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in further exploration and discussion of the ethics of
    "raw" data, please consider reading <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html"
    rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Drucker''s article</a> which has made useful distinctions
    between "data" (understood as given) and "capta" (taken or "captured") that also
    troubles the distinction between "raw" and "processed" data.</p>

    <a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#data-and-labor" id="user-content-data-and-labor"><span
    aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data and Labor</h2>

    <p>As we think about data collection, we should also consider the labor involved
    in the process. Many researchers rely on Amazon Mechanical Turk (sometimes also
    referred to as MTurk) for data collection, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/amazon-mechanical-turk/551192/"
    rel="nofollow" target="_blank">often paying less than minimum wage for the task.</a>
    Often the assumption made of these workers is someone who is retired, bored, and
    participating in online gig work for fun or to kill time. While this may be true
    for some, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/11/17/labor-platforms-technology-enabled-gig-work/"
    rel="nofollow" target="_blank">more than half of those surveyed in a Pew Research
    study cite that the income from this work is essential or important</a>. Those
    who do view the income from this work as essential or important are also mostly
    from underserved communities.</p>

    <p>In addition to being mindful of paying a fair wage to the workers on such platforms,
    this kind of working environment also brings some further considerations to the
    data that is collected. For instance, to get close to minimum wage, workers cannot
    afford to spend much time on each task. Thinking through these circumstances,
    how do you think it impacts the data we collected?</p>

    <p>For a deeper discussion on data and labor, consider Catherine D''Ignazio and

    <li>I usually go with the conventions of the field as it allows me to share my
    "in progress" work easily with my research lab and collaborators. The file conventions
    can range from <code>.csv</code> to <code>.json</code>.</li>

    <li>I will keep columns (variables) relevant to my question, such as the <code>Artist
    Gender</code>, <code>Is Public Domain</code> and <code>Rights and Reproduction</code>
    columns. I will also keep some of the descriptive columns such as <code>Object
    ID</code> and <code>Artist Role</code> to help contextualize the results (e.g.
    what kind of roles do female artists tend to take on?)</li>

    <li>I will choose to keep it in a <code>.csv</code> file type as it can be opened
    up by more programs and if Microsoft stops supporting <code>.xlsx</code> file
    types I may no longer have access to opening the dataset. <strong>or</strong>
    I will choose to switch to a <code>.xlsx</code> format as it is easier to use

    \ open or (re)used (e.g. .mac). For accessibility, future-proofing, and preservation,\
    \ keep your data in open, sustainable formats. A demonstration:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open\

    question: Tiny data format only allows one value per cell.
  - answers:
      correct: []
      incorrect: []
    question: Do you think you can explain the rules of tidy data structuring?
  solution: '<ol>

    <li>

    <code>Artist Role</code>, <code>Artist Display Name</code>, <code>Artist Display
    Bio</code>, <code>Artist Alpha Sort</code>, <code>Artist Nationality</code>, <code>Artist
    Begin Date</code>, <code>Artist End Date</code>, or <code>Classification</code>.</li>

    <li>I will choose to convert to the tidy data format if I was interested in any
    of the variables listed above, so that it will be easier to analyse the entries.
    I will have to unnest the entries by separating the data into different rows.
    For example, if I am interested in understanding the type of roles that are predominantly
    held by non-cisgender men, I will unnest the column <code>Artist Role</code>.
    An entry like <code>Architect|Artist</code> will be separated into two rows as
    illustrated in this example:</li>

      - when the same unit of measure is used in all relevant measurements.
    question: Measurements are <em>accurate</em> when
  solution: '<ol>

    <li>I think this is often decided before the cleaning process begins, perhaps
    after some quick visualization or analysis of the "raw" data. I generally remove
    empty entries from my data sets. Working with social media data, I also usually
    remove URLs as these influence the topic modelling algorithms (e.g. "http" may
    end up being the most prominent topic of the corpus). This is usually where I
    stop cleaning. Some might suggest the removal of stop words like "the" "a" "an,"
    but I have always felt very uncertain about the removal of these words. This is
    especially because the dictionary of stop words were generated through canon western
    texts that is not representative of the many variations of English. For example,
    if I were looking at the tweets of Singaporean youths, the stop word dictionary
    may not be appropriate.</li>

    <li>For me, the data is often destroyed (usually because IRB desires it) or it
    remains in the original "raw" file. The file that I clean will always be a duplicate
    file to allow for recovery in case I made a poor decision in the process of cleaning.</li>

    <li>Exploring the dataset, here are my responses to the questions:

    <ul>

    <li>Using <code>Object ID</code> indicates that there is no duplicates in the
    dataset. Every entry is unique.</li>

    <li>I will have to compare it to another trusted source like a database from <a
    href="https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/" rel="nofollow">The Getty Research
    Institute</a>.</li>

    <li>The data collected is not completed. There are missing fields. Depending on
    where the missing field is, I may choose to code it as <code>0</code> for the
    ease of analysis. For example, the column <code>Dynasty</code> only contain 1
    meaningful entry within this sample data set, as such, I will not run any analysis
    that may rely on this column and choose to drop it. The column <code>Accession
    Year</code> only has 1 NA and I will choose to drop that row if this becomes a
    useful variable for my analysis.</li>

    <li>While the <code>Rights and Reproduction</code> contains a lot of NA and inappropriate
    responses (e.g. "Ceramics"), for the most part, for the items labeled as <code>YES</code>
    in the column <code>Is Public Domain</code> the corresponding column in <code>Rights
    and Reproduction</code> does not record a copyright holder. I am assuming that
    the NA can stand in for the object being in the public domain.</li>

    <li>Taking only <code>Female</code> as a valid gender response, everything else
    will be converted to a <code>0</code> for ease of analysis. I am assuming <code>|</code>
    as equivalent to a NA or an empty field rather than an alternative gender. Hence
    in my analysis, the proportion will only record female artists'' objects against
    the rest of the collected items. I cannot necessarily answer the larger question
    of all non-cisgender men against the total in this case.</li>

    </ul>

    <ol>

    <li>Empty fields</li>

    <li>Multiple formats, such as "yes" or "y" or "1" for a positive response.</li>

    <h3>

    <a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#validity" id="user-content-validity"><span
    aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Validity</h3>

    <p>Measurements must be valid, in that they must conform to set constraints:</p>

    <ol>

    <li>The aforementioned "yes" or "y" or "1" should all be changed to one response.</li>

    <li>Certain fields cannot be empty, or the whole observation must be thrown out.</li>

    <li>Uniqueness, for instance no two people should have the same social security
    number.</li>

    <h3>

    <a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#accuracy" id="user-content-accuracy"><span

    <p>Measurements must be accurate, in that they must represent the correct values.
    While an observation may be valid, it might at the same time be inaccurate. 123
    Fake street is a valid, inaccurate street address.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, accuracy is mostly achieved in the observation process. To be
    achieved in the cleaning process, an outside trusted source would have to be cross-referenced.</p>

    <a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#completeness" id="user-content-completeness"><span

    <p>Measurements must be complete, in that they must represent everything that
    might be known. This also is nearly impossible to achieve in the cleaning process!
    For instance in a survey, it would be necessary to re-interview someone whose
    previous answer to a question was left blank.</p>

    <h3>

    <a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#consistency" id="user-content-consistency"><span
    aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Consistency</h3>

    <p>Measurements must be consistent, in that different observations must not contradict
    each other. For instance, one person cannot be represented as both dead and still
    alive in different observations.</p>

    <a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#uniformity" id="user-content-uniformity"><span
    aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Uniformity</h3>

    <p>Measurements must be uniform, in that the same unit of measure must be used
    in all relevant measurements. If one person''s height is listed in meters and
    another in feet, one measurement must be converted.</p>'

      correct:
      - 'True'
      incorrect:
      - 'False'
    question: Descriptive analysis help us summarize a data set.
  solution: '<ol>

    <li>I may choose to leave out data that are perceived to be outliers, especially
    if they differ to much from the "normal" curve. I end up representing only those
    who fall within the "normal" curve which may not actually be an equitable representation.</li>

    <li>The interpretation of the results should align itself with the type of analyses
    that I ran. In addition, it should be guided in some capacity by previous work
    in this area to inform my understanding.</li>

    <li>Potential misuse that I am always concern with is the weaponziation of marginalized
    participants'' words and thoughts. I think I remain somewhat uncomfortable with
    the unintended use of my research because I don''t think I can ever consider every
    circumstances that the analysis can be misused or misquoted. When I was working
    on an oral history project, I have set up some layers of boundaries to prevent
    too easy of an access to audio files as an attempt at negotiating access and protection
    of my narrators.</li>

    <li>In chasing the next big thing, the original intentions for beginning the project
    might be lost. For me, making sure that my work is meaningful to my communities
    is important and the excitement of exploring a new tool can sometimes distract
    me from this intention. Running out of time and/or budget can also mean that the
    project may end abruptly, and relationships built could be strained in a haphazard
    wrap up. This brings me back to making sure that before the project begins to
    spend a significant amount of time on project planning to reduce the chances of
    this happening.</li>

    <p>As we have discussed thus far, data are not neutral or objective. They are
    guided by and produced through our interests and assumptions, often shaped by
    our socio-political contexts. Hence, we must also understand that the forms of
    analyses we take to our data further shapes how we are choosing to tell the story.
    We are crafting a narrative through each of the stages of data that helps us communicate
    our projects to a wider audience. This is not to say that our analyses are not
    "empirical" or "scientific" but a suggestion to make transparent the theoretical
    foundations and perspectives that are guiding our interpretations. For a more

    <ol>

    <li>What are we assuming when we choose to visually represent data in particular
    ways?</li>

    <li>As you may have realized, many of the visualization examples work with quantitative
    data, as such, how do you think we can visualize qualitative data? (e.g. Word
    Clouds, Heat Map)</li>

    How might you explain what your visualization represents?</li>

    </ol>'
  keywords: []
  order: 8
  questions: []
  solution: '<ol>

    <li>An underlying assumption we make is that the conventions of top-down, left-right
    is universal or at least universal enough for most folx to understand. This neglects
    potential right-to-left readers. Certain conventions that use color as a way to
    represent good and bad (e.g. green as good and red as bad) also assumes that this
    is an effective differentiation that excludes those who have visual impairments
    can decipher the data in a similar fashion.</li>

    <li>Exploring <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/" rel="nofollow">Voyant-Tools</a>
    can be a good place to start to see how visualization of qualitative data can
    look like.</li>

    <li>Exaggerated differences through the choice of scales on the x and y-axis can
    misled a casual viewer to think that the data is representing a larger difference
    than it actually is reporting.</li>

    <li>Data visualization can help us convey dense information quickly. The casual
    viewer can glance at the visualization and understand what we are trying to communicate
    with our data. Data visualization also can be affective device, like the DuBois''
    examples which helps to tell the urgency of the narrative/story.</li>

    <li>The difficulty of representing this dataset is how at first glance there''s
    an assumption that gender is binary given that only 2 bars are representing the
    dataset. Even though the other bar is labeled <code>Unknown</code> to suggest
    that this is not a comprehensive breakdown, I''m not sure how effective it is.

  text: "<p>Data and ethics are contextually driven. As such, there isn\u2019t always\
    \ a risk-free approach. We often have to work through ethical dilemmas while thinking\
    \ through information that we may not have (what are the risks of doing/not doing\
    \ this work?). We have approached a moment where the question is no longer what\
    \ we could do but what we should do. Given this saturated data-driven world we\
    \ currently live in, there is value in pausing and consider why and what we are\
    \ collecting, researching, analyzing, and understanding. Starting on a new project,\
    \ especially one dealing with \"big\" data can be exciting but we now also have\
    \ to first consider who does the data collected benefit and <a href=\"https://www.manifestno.com/\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">why is it important are important</a>. The\
    \ IRB (Institutional Review Board)'s regulations may form the starting point of\
    \ our considerations but should not be the ending point of how we consider contextually-driven\
    \ ethics and data projects.</p>\n<p>In addition, open access is not always the\
    \ answer to concerns of reproducibility and/or ethical considerations. There are\
    \ moments where the decision to not have a dataset or analysis openly accessible\
    \ is valid. For example, when you are working with marginalized or vulnerable\
    \ populations, concerns for causing more harm justifies restricting access. We\
    \ may choose to control who has access to decrease the chances of misrepresentations\
    \ (intentional or otherwise) or having results taken out of contexts.</p>\n<p>For\

  intro: Now that you've gained an understanding of some of the considerations around
    data and ethics, let's think a bit further about how you may apply some of what
    we have discussed in your work.  Below you will find some additional readings
    that dives deeper into some of the topics that were covered in our lessons. If
    you would like, you can also consider exploring the `Projects or Challenges to
    Try` to see how you might apply what you've learnt.
