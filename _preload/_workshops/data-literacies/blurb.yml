text: My first foray into data literacies began when I was considering the ethics
  of conducting a digital oral history archival project. Concerned with how my oral
  history interviews with queer and trans Asians may be manipulated or remixed without
  consent, I began to actively look for answers to my questions on doing digital projects
  with marginalized communities. This led to no easy answers, and I found myself at
  the beginning of a very complex but necessary journey through data literacies and
  ethics. What did become clear is that ethical considerations cannot stop at an IRB
  but has to be negotiated at every step of the way. Important questions that emerged
  in my process are:<br />a) Am I comfortable with the unintentional use of my data/results/analyses?<br
  />b) Who is benefiting from my project?, and<br />c) Who is left out in my analysis?<br
  />As we are living in a data saturated world, these questions also help in keeping
  me grounded and accountable. These questions also reflect the complexities of ethics
  in a digital project; there is no universal fit or easy answers. Drawing on my experiences,
  the workshop on data literacies will begin with exploring some of these concerns."
