    what: '<p><a href="http://www.nltk.org/" rel="nofollow">NLTK</a> stands for Natural
      Language Tool Kit, and it is an open source Python library for analyzing language
      data. It is used for Python programs that work with text in statistical natural
      language processing (NLP). In plain terms, NLTK allows users to work with collections
      of text to clean, categorize, and analyze that text. As such, it is an excellent
      tool for text analysis.

      ATTENTION: NLTK comes installed with the <a href="conda.md">conda</a> package
      managment system and may already be installed in your environment.</p>'
    why: <p>For the Digital Humanities Research Institute, we use NLTK because it
      is a rich library of natural language processing tools and datasets. It works
      very well with Python, allowing users to write powerful natural language processing
      programs with relatively short sections of code.</p>

      text: <p>Now that Anaconda is installed, you need to ensure that Anaconda is
        updated to the newest version for this workshop. Go to our Insight section
        for <a href="https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/insights/blob/v2.0/pages/anaconda.md">Keeping
        your Anaconda installation up to date</a> to learn more about how to keep
        your Anaconda installation up-to-date.</p>
    what: <p><a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" rel="nofollow">Anaconda</a>
      is a distribution of Python. It provides a Python programming environment, the
      Jupyter notebook environment, and the conda package management system.</p>
    why: <p>For the Digital Humanities Research Institute, we are choosing to use
      and download Anaconda as it allow us to get all the required software for this
      institute (python, conda, and the Jupyter notebook environment) in a single
      download. Anaconda also includes many useful packages for machine learning,
      and data analysis that will be helpful should you choose to go further in your
      Python journey!.</p>
