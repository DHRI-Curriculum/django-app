introduction-website: "<p class=\"lead\">The Digital Humanities Research Institute curriculum features workshops, tutorials, glossaries, resources, reading materials, and more that have been developed at The Graduate Center, City Univerity of New York since 2016. As part of a 2019 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities Institutes in Advance Topics in the Digital Humanities (IATDH) grant, the curriculum, originally developed for in-person workshops, was revised to better meet the needs of virtual instruction due to the covid-19 pandemic. While the curriculum has always been available openly on GitHub, this new version creates a more user-friendly interface with increased functionality that is designed for public use.</p>"

introduction-curriculum: "<p class=\"lead\">The DHRI curriculum focuses on technical skills and concepts upon which additional technologies and tools rely. Approximately one-third of all workshops at the Institute could be described as foundational: they introduce concepts such as the command line, version control & data collaboration, data literacy, and an introduction to programming with Python. The materials and workshops on this site are designed for users who are either unfamiliar with technology or could simply benefit from filling in gaps in their knowledge. Workshops and tutorials here encourage the use of open source technologies making them accessible to the widest possible audiences. We believe our emphasis on foundational skills demonstrates our commitment to empowering humanities researchers to become confident self-teachers and mentors in their own right who can make informed decisions about their research materials and methods that will lead to successful, sustainable, and long-term research goals.

introduction-context: "<p>Why am I learning this? Why does it matter? How will it help my project? Learning new digital skills is an investment of your valuable time, so it is reasonable to want to know--essentially--what will I get out of taking this workshop? The materials below help situate the skills are about to learn within a larger context of how they are used, by whom, and to what ends.</p>"

introduction-ethical-considerations: "<p>Digital tools and the skills required to use them are part of our culture and therefore never objective. Digital humanists and social scientists consider the ethical challenges and responsibilities of the tools and methods that they use. The following materials are designed to introduce you to issues you may want to consider as you learn this new skill and decide how to integrate it into your own research and teaching.</p>"

introduction-projects: "<p>The following are sample projects that use the skill or tool (either implicitly or explicitly) that you are about to learn. Some skills that are foundational may seem not to lead to a specific project goal that you have in mind. You might be surprised to learn that the following projects depend on the skills learned in this workshop.</p>"

introduction-readings: "<p>The readings listed below are meant to place the skill or tool you are about to learn within ongiong conversations in either the humanities or humanistic social sciences. In many cases, the readings provide a theoretical framework to use to approach the skill or tool you are using or to introduce some of the debates around the ways in which the tool or skill has been put to use thusfar. </p>"


introduction-tutorials: "<p>This should be 2–3 sentences about why it is good to engage with tutorials beyond those that we offer here on the site: they go deeper, more in specific directions, or engage with different tools that nonetheless help scholars navigate the technological landscape.</p>"

introduction-resources: "<p>Note: obsolete... This should be 2–3 sentences about what the \"resources\" are on the website. We can hold off on this for now, since I am going to re-draft the look/name of the \"Library\" page into a \"Resource\" page so this will likely not be here soon.</p>"
