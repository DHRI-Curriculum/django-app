We know that websites are hypertext, meaning that we can click between links, travelling from page to page until we find what we need. What may be less obvious about websites is that, fundamentally <strong>websites are plain text documents</strong>, usually written in HTML or another web-based markup language, such as XML or XHTML.</p><p>\n<em>Fun fact</em>: <strong>Nearly 80% of all websites (whose markup language we know) use HTML.</strong></p><p>\n<a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ml-html/all/all\">(w3techs.com)</a></p>\n<h2>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h2>\n<p>HTML is a markup language used to write web-based documents. It enables us to provide web browsers with information about the <em>content</em> of a document. We can, for example, indicate that some part of our document is a paragraph, image, heading, or link. The browser uses this information when displaying the document for users.</p>\n<h2>Markup language vs. programming Language</h2>\n<p>HTML is a <em>markup</em> language, not a programming language. Programming languages are used to transform data, by creating scripts that organize an output of data based on a particular input of data. A markup language is used to control the presentation of data.</p><p>\nFor a practical example of this difference, we can think about tables. A programming language can help you search through a table, understand the kinds of data the table includes, find particular data points, or transform its content into other kinds of data, such as frequencies. A markup language would instead determine the content, layout, and visual presentation of the table.</p><p>\nFundamentally, then, a script or program is a set of instructions given to the computer. A document in a markup language determines how information is presented to a user.</p><p>\n<strong>NOTE - Markup vs Markdown:</strong> Markdown and HTML are both types of markup languages; Markdown is a play on words. Markup languages help format content.</p>\n<h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>\n<p>CSS is usually used in conjunction with HTML. HTML tells the browser what the different parts of a document <em>are</em>. CSS tells the browser what the parts of the document should <em>look like</em>. It is essentially a set of rules that are applied when rendering an HTML document. Its name\u2014Cascading Style Sheets\u2014refers to the fact that there is an order of precedence in how the browswer applies CSS rules to a document. More specific rules overwrite less specific rules.</p>\n<h2>Where does the internet come in?</h2>\n<p>Together, these languages can be used to write and style a website using a text editor (such as VS Code) directly from your computer. No internet access needed.</p><p>\nHowever, internet access is necessary if you plan on making your website available to the public.

Navigate to your projects folder using this command:</p><p>\n<code>bash\n    cd ~/Desktop/projects</code></p><p>\n3. Create a new folder:</p><p>\n<code>bash\n    mkdir htmlpractice</code></p><p>\n4.

Paste the template above (starting with <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>) into the new file.</p><p>\nThe <code>index.html</code> file is your default homepage for the website we are creating. This is an industry standard, because web browsers tend to recognize the <code>index.html</code> page as the opening page to the directory that is your website. See <a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/index-html-page-3466505\">here</a> for more explanation.</p><p>\nOnce you've created your new file, open it with a web browser using your graphical user interface:</p><p>\nOn macOS, click on the Finder in your dock (the apps at the bottom of the screen) and click on Desktop on the left. From there, navigate to <code>projects</code>, then <code>htmlpractice</code>. Alternately, you can click the projects folder icon on your Desktop and find it from there. If you're using a Mac and would prefer to use the command line, you can also type <code>open index.html</code> from within your <code>htmlpractice</code> folder.</p><p>\nOn Windows, click the <code>projects</code> folder icon on your desktop. Navigate to <code>projects</code>, then <code>htmlpractice</code>. Double click the <code>index.html</code> file.

They provide information about the structure of a web page, showing how its parts work together. Those who make use of assistive technologies such as screen readers rely on this semantic information to navigate the page. Thus, it's important to use elements such as headers only when the information being marked calls for it. Making text large and/or bold for visual effect should be done using CSS.

Hyperlinking text enables users to move between the different webpages on your site (sometimes in the form of a menu or navigation bar), or connect to other resources or information on other websites.</p><p>\nThe <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, or <strong>anchor tag</strong>, creates a link to another document. You can use the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag to link to other documents or webpages you created for the same site or to documents located elsewhere on the web. You can also use it to link to a particular location on a page\u2014we'll see an example of this in the section on classes and ids.</p>\n<h2>Option One: Relative Links</h2>\n<p>Relative links take the current page as an origin point and search for other files within the same folder or directory. This method is useful for creating links to pages within your own site.</p><p>\nThe following appears as a link to the <code>about.html</code> page in the same folder as <code>index.html</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">a</span> <span class=\"na\">href</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"about.html\"</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>About<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">a</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>On your webpage it will appear as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"#\">About</a></p><p>\nThis link is asking the browser to look for a file titled <code>about.html</code> in the same folder. If a file named <code>about.html</code> is not in the same folder, clicking the link will result in a <code>404</code> (\"Page Not Found\") error.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Option Two: Absolute Links</h2>\n<p>An absolute link includes information that allows the browser to find resources on other websites. This information includes the site domain\u2014such as <code>google.com</code>\u2014and often the protocol\u2014such as <code>http</code> or <code>https</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">a</span> <span class=\"na\">href</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"http://www.google.com\"</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>Google<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">a</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>On your webpage it will appear as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.google.com\">Google</a></p><p>\nThis pathway is directing your browser to look online for this text document at the URL address provided.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>More on links</h2>\n<p>Each example above includes an <code>href</code> tag. The <code>href</code> tag, short for hypertext reference, is an example of an <strong>attribute</strong>. Attributes offer secondary information about an element.</p><p>\nThe <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, or anchor tag, creates a link. The text within the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code> tags, the anchor text, is what a visitor to the site will see and can click on. The <code>href=</code> attribute tells the browser where the user should be directed when they click the link.</p><p>\nThere is another technical difference between the two options above.</p>\n<h2>Relative vs. Absolute Links: When to use which</h2>\n<p>Use relative links when referring to pages on your own site. The main advantage of using relative links to pages on your site is that your site will not break if it is moved to a different folder or environment.</p>\n<h2>Activity</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new text file called <code>about.html</code> in your <code>htmlpractice</code> folder.

In this link, call your <code>index.html</code> page <code>Home</code> (Reminder: <code>index.html</code> is the default homepage)</li>\n<li>Lastly, include an absolute link to a page of your choosing. Remember that an absolute link includes the protocol (for example, <code>http:</code>) and also a domain (for example, <code>cuny.edu</code>), such as <code>http://cuny.edu/about</code>.</li>\n<li>Re-save your text files and reopen or refresh them in your browser.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Check if it worked</h2>\n<p>When your pages are updated, you should be able to navigate from your Home page to your About page, and vice versa.

Similar to the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> requires an attribute, in this case <code>src</code>. The <code>src</code> attribute stands for \"source\" and communicates secondary information to your browser that identifies and locates the image. Unlike many other tags, the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag does not need to be closed, making it an example of a void tag.</p><p>\nThe following element pulls in an image located in the same folder as the <code>.html</code> file:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">img</span> <span class=\"na\">src</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"scream.jpeg\"</span> <span class=\"p\">/&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The same rules apply here as with the <code>href</code> attribute: if the image is not located in the same folder as the document you are writing in, the browser won't find it.

When this is the case, it can be helpful to keep images in a separate folder within your site's structure. To enable the browser to find an image in that case, just add the directory in front of the file name. For example, if you have a folder named images in the same folder as your index.html file, and scream.jpeg is in that folder, you'd change the void tag above to <code>&lt;img src=\"/images/scream.jpeg\" /&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h2>Making images accessible</h2>\n<p>As briefly noted earlier, alternative text, or alt text, is descriptive \"text associated with an image that serves the same purpose and conveys the same essential information as the image\" (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Accessibility/Alternative_text_for_images\">Wikipedia Manual of Style/Accessibility/Alternative Text for Images</a> for more), and is important for ensuring content conveyed by images is accessible to all.</p><p>\nTo add alternative text to an image, you add an additional attribute, <code>alt</code> followed by your descriptive text.

For example, to add a link to the page that takes the user directly to the line that reads \"New York Mets,\" we might write HTML like this: <code>&lt;a href=\"#mets\"&gt;Mets&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h2>CSS selectors</h2>\n<p>Class selectors in CSS are denoted with a period in front of the class name you're creating.

When rendered by your browser, these tags tell your browser that certain content is paragraph text, while other content is heading or title text, and so on. You can also use <a href=\"07-images.md\">image (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>)</a> and <a href=\"06-links.md\">link or anchor (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>)</a> tags to tell the browser to render an image on the page, or take the visitor to another page on your or another website. We also discussed some important <a href=\"08-conventions.md\">conventions</a> to consider when creating HTML documents, such as nesting.</p><p>\nCSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, allows for further styling of your website through the application of a series of <a href=\"12-rules.md\">rule sets</a> that are applied to different aspects/elements of your site. In order for CSS to render on a webpage, it must be <a href=\"11-integration.md\">integrated with your html</a>, which can happen in three ways: inline, internal, and external. CSS rules can be of varying specificity, and in particular, through creating <a href=\"14-classes.md\">classes and ids</a>. We also discussed how the ordering of rule sets doesn't matter, because an important function of CSS is the way it filters and applies rules in accordance with the specificity of the rule.</p><p>\nThrough understanding these languages in combination with one another, you can also reframe your understanding of the web\u2014not as <em>poof! magic!</em>, but as a series of intentionally styled, hyperlinked text documents, with each website representing a folder of documents.</p><p>\nWhile this is a good starting point, one important question remains: how can I get these text documents on the Internet so they can be accessed, and interacted with, and linked to by others?</p>", "order": 18}}, {"model": "lesson.lesson", "pk": 1298, "fields": {"title": "Making your Website Public", "created": "2020-07-10T13:45:43.903Z", "updated": "2020-07-10T13:45:43.903Z", "workshop": 177, "text": "<p>Great job! Now you have an amazing website, but it's stuck on your computer where no one else can find it or view it. How do you get your website onto the Internet so it can be shared?</p><p>\nTo get your site on the internet, you'll need <strong>hosting</strong> \u2014 that is, a remote computer that will stay on day in and day out to serve the website to visitors. In theory, you could host your website on your own computer, but in practice, it usually makes sense to purchase hosting from a hosting company or use a free service.</p><p>\nYou'll also need a way of getting your website to your host. That's where FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, comes in.</p>\n<h2>FTP</h2>\n<p>FTP is a protocol used to share files from your computer (<em>a client</em>) to another computer called a server, and back again over the Internet. This is something we do ALL THE TIME, but we refer to it as \"uploading\" and \"downloading.\"</p><p>\nNote: Though FTP stands for file transfer protocol, you are not really transfering or moving your files from your computer; instead they are <em>copied</em> to the server. Fear not!</p><p>\nIn order to transfer your website files (also called your website's directory) to a server you will need:</p><p>\n1. Access to the Internet.</p><p>\n2. An FTP Client.</p><p>\n3. A server that is connected to the Internet where you can send your files.</p><p>\nAssuming you all can manage accessing the internet on your own, let's focus on the latter two.</p>\n<h3>FTP client</h3>\n<p>An <strong>FTP client</strong> is software designed specifically for the purpose of sharing files between computers. There are widely-used, freely-available GUI applications (i.e., applications that use a graphic user interface, or the point-and-click, user-friendly software interfaces you are used to) that you can download for use, including <a href=\"https://filezilla-project.org/\">Filezilla</a> and <a href=\"https://cyberduck.io/\">Cyberduck</a>. You can also run an FTP client program through the command line on most computers, though the process varies by operating system.</p>\n<h3>Other Resources about FTP</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2010/02/ftp_for_beginners/\">FTP for Beginners, <em>Wired</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/free-ftp-clients-windows/\">The Three Best FTP Clients for Windows</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/how-to/software/operating-systems/how-to-use-ftp-through-the-command-line-in-mac-os-x-1305664\">How To Use FTP Through the Command Line in Mac OS X</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-to-use-mac-terminal-ftp-sftp-client/\">How to Use the Mac Terminal as an FTP or SFTP Client</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Web hosting</h2>\n<p>You also need a server to transfer your files to, where they can be stored and shared on the Internet. This is what we call <strong>web hosting</strong> and there are multiple options here as well. The GCDI (CUNY Graduate Center Digital Initiatives) website contains a list of <a href=\"https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/digital-resource-guide/#cloud\">low-cost cloud hosting services for students</a>.
