After that, it goes through further transformations:</p>\n<h2>Raw</h2>\n<p>Raw data is yet to be processed, meaning it has yet to be manipulated by a human or computer. Received or collected data could be in any number of formats, locations, etc.. It could be in any of the forms listed above.</p><p>\nBut \"raw data\" is a relative term, inasmuch as when one person finishes processing data and presents it as a finished product, another person may take that product and work on it further, and for them that data is \"raw data\". </p>\n<h2>Data and Labor</h2>\n<p>As we think about data collection, we should also consider the labor involved in the process. Many researchers rely on Amazon Mechanical Turk (sometimes also refered to as MTurk) for data collection, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/amazon-mechanical-turk/551192/\">often paying less than minimum wage for the task.</a> Often the assumption made of these workers is someone who is retired, bored, and participating in online gig work for fun or to kill time. While this may be true for some, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/11/17/labor-platforms-technology-enabled-gig-work/\">more than half of those surveyed in a Pew Research study cite that the income from this work is essential or important.</a> Often, those who view the income from this work as essential or important are also from underserved communities. </p><p>\nIn addition to being mindful of paying a fair wage to the workers on such platforms, this working environment also brings some further considerations to the data that is collected. Often times, for workers to get close to minimum wage, they cannot afford to spend much time on each task, increasing potential errors in the collected data. </p>\n<h3>Challenge: Raw Data and Labor</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>For example, is \"big data\" \"raw data\"? How do we understand data that we have \"scraped\"? </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Processed/Transformed</h2>\n<p>Processing data puts it into a state more readily available for analysis, and makes the data legible.

Impossible negative numbers, like an age of \"-37\"</p><p>\n5. Dubious outliers</p><p>\n6. Duplicated rows</p><p>\n7. And many more!</p><p>\nCleaning data is the work of correcting the errors listed above, and moving towards high quality. This work can be done manually or programatically. </p><p>\n<strong>Validity</strong></p><p>\nMeasurements must be valid, in that they must conform to set constraints:</p><p>\n1. The aforementioned \"yes\" or \"y\" or \"1\" should all be changed to one response.</p><p>\n2. Certain fields cannot be empty, or the whole observation must be thrown out.</p><p>\n3. Uniqueness, for instance no two people should have the same social security number.</p><p>\n<strong>Accuracy</strong></p><p>\nMeasurements must be accurate, in that they must represent the correct values. While an observation may be valid, it might at the same time be inaccurate. 123 Fake street is a valid, inaccurate street address.</p><p>\nUnfortunately, accuracy is mostly acheived in the observation process.

This also is nearly impossible to achieve in the cleaning process! For instance in a survey, it would be necessary to re-interview someone whose previous answer to a question was left blank. </p><p>\n<strong>Consistency</strong></p><p>\nMeasurements must be consistent, in that different observations must not contradict each other.

By completing this tutorial, you will have a general sense of how to turn text into data using the Python package, NLTK. You will also be able to take publicly available text files and transform them into a corpus that you can perform your own analysis on. Finally, you will have some insight into the types of questions that can be addressed with text analysis.</p>\n<h2>Setup and installation</h2>\n<p>If you have not already installed the <a href=\"https://www.anaconda.com/download/\">Anaconda</a> distribution of Python 3, please do so.</p><p>\nYou will also need <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/nltk.md\"><code>nltk</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/conda.md\"><code>matplotlib</code></a> to complete this tutorial. Both packages come installed with Anaconda. To check to be sure you have them, open a new Jupyter Notebook (or any IDE to run Python).</p><p>\nFind Anaconda Navigator on your computer (it should be located in the folder with your other applications), and from Acadonda Navigator's interface, launch a Jupyter Notebook.</p><p>\n<img alt=\"jupyter notebook launch screen\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/text-analysis/jupyter.png\"/></p><p>\nIt will open in the browser. All of the directories (folders) in your home directory will appear — we'll get to that later. For now, select <code>New</code> &gt;&gt; <code>Python3</code> in the upper right corner.</p><p>\n<img alt='jupyter notebook \"open new file\" screen' src=\"/static/images/lessons/text-analysis/jupyter1.png\"/></p><p>\nA blank page with an empty box should appear.</p><p>\n<img alt=\"empty box on jupyter notebook new file\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/text-analysis/jupyter2.png\"/></p><p>\nIn the box, type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">nltk</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">matplotlib</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Press <code>Shift + Enter</code> to run the cell (or click run at the top of the page). Don't worry too much about what this is doing - that will be explained later in this tutorial. For now, we just want to make sure the packages we will need are installed.</p><p>\n<img alt=\"commands above in a jupyter notebook cell\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/text-analysis/jupyter3.png\"/></p><p>\nIf nothing happens, they are installed and you are ready to move on! If you get an error message, either you have a typo or they are not installed. If it is the latter, open the command line and type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>conda install nltk -y\nconda install matplotlib -y\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now we need to install the nltk corpus. This is very large and may take some time if you are on a weak connection.</p><p>\nIn the next cell, type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">nltk</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">download</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>and run the cell.</p><p>\nThe NLTK downloader should appear. Please install all of the packages. If you are short on time, focus on \"book\" for this tutorial—you can download the other packages at another time for later use.</p><p>\nYours will look a little different, but the same interface. Click on the 'all' option and then 'Download'. Once they all trun green, you can close the Downloader dialogue box.</p><p>\n<img alt=\"nltk downloader screen\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/text-analysis/nltk.png\"/></p><p>\nReturn to your Jupyter Notebook and type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">nltk.book</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>A list of books should appear. If this happens, great! If not, return to the downloader to make sure everything is ok.</p><p>\nClose this Notebook without saving — the only purpose was to check if we have the appropriate packages installed.</p>",

            "text": "<p>When we think of \"data,\" we often think of numbers, things that can be summarized, statisticized, and graphed. Rarely when I ask people \"what is data?\" do they respond \"<em>Moby Dick</em>.\" And yet, more and more, text is data. Whether it is <em>Moby Dick</em>, or every romance novel written since 1750, or today's newspaper or twitter feed, we are able to transform written (and spoken) language into data that can be quantified and visualized.</p>\n<h2>Corpora</h2>\n<p>The first step in gathering insights from texts is to create a <strong>corpus</strong>. A corpus is a collection of texts that are somehow related to each other. For example, the <a href=\"https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/\">Corpus of Contemporary American English</a>, <a href=\"http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/\">Donald Trump's Tweets</a>, <a href=\"https://byts.commons.gc.cuny.edu/\">text messages</a> sent by bilingual young adults, <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers/\">digitized newspapers</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/\">books</a> in the public domain are all corpora. There are infinitely many corpora, and, sometimes, you will want to make your own—that is, one that best fits your research question.</p><p>\nThe route you take from here will depend on your research question. Let's say, for example, that you want to examine gender differences in writing style. Based on previous linguistic research, you hypothesize that male-identified authors use more definitives than female-identified. So you collect two corpora—one written by men, one written by women—and you count the number of <em>the</em>s, <em>this</em>s, and <em>that</em>s compared to the number of <em>a</em>s, <em>an</em>s, and <em>one</em>s. Maybe you find a difference, maybe you don't. We can already see that this is a relatively crude way of going about answering this question, but it is a start. (More likely, you'd use a <em>supervised classification task</em>, which you will learn about in the <a href=\"https://www.github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/machine-learning\">Machine Learning Tutorial</a>.)</p><p>\nThere has been some research about how the <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/331/6014/176.full.pdf\">linguistic complexity of written language</a> in long-form pieces (i.e., books, articles, letters, etc.) has decreased over time. Simply put, people today use shorter sentences with fewer embedded clauses and complex tense constructions than people did in the past. (Note that this is not necessarily a bad or good thing.) Based on this research, we want to know if short-form platforms are emblematic of the change (we predict that they are based on our own experience with short-form platforms like email and Twitter). One way to do this would be to use Part-of-Speech tagging. Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a way to identify the category of words in a given text.</p><p>\nFor example, the sentence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I like the red bicycle.</p><p>\nhas one pronoun, one verb, one determiner, one adjective, and one noun.</p><p>\n(I : Pronoun), (like : Verb), (the : Determiner), (red : Adjective), (bicycle : Noun)</p><p>\nNLTK uses the <a href=\"https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html\">Penn Tree Bank Tag Set</a>. This is a very detailed tag list that goes far beyond just nouns, verbs, and adjectives, but gives insight into different types of nouns, prepositions, and verbs as well. Virtually all POS taggers will create a list of (word, POS) pairs. If newspaper articles have a higher ratio of function words (prepositions, auxiliaries, determiners, etc.) to semantic words (nouns, verbs, adjectives), than tweets, then we have one piece of evidence supporting our hypothesis. It's important to note here that we must use either ratios or otherwise normalized data (in the sense that raw numbers will not work). Because of the way that language works (function words are often repeated, for example), a sample of 100 words will have more unique words than a sample of 1,000. Therefore, to compare different data types (articles vs. tweets), this fact should be taken into account.</p>\n</blockquote>",

            "text": "<p>Generally, however, our questions are more about topics rather than writing style. So, once we have a corpus—whether that is one text or millions—we usually want to clean and normalize it. There are three terms we are going to need:</p><p>\n- <strong>Text normalization</strong> is the process of taking a list of words and transforming it into a more uniform sequence. Usually, this involves removing punctuation, making the words all the same case, removing <em>stop words</em>, and either <em>stemming</em> or <em>lemmatizing</em> the words. It can also include expanding abbreviations or matching misspellings (but these are advanced practices that we will not cover).</p><p>\nYou probably know what removing punctuation and capitalization refer to, but the other terms may be new:</p><p>\n- <strong>Stop words</strong> are words that appear frequently in a language, often adding grammatical structure, but little semantic content. There is no official list of stop words for any language, though there are some common, all-purpose lists built in to NLTK. However, different tasks require different lists. The purpose of removing stop words is to remove words that are so common that their meaning is diminished across a large number of texts.</p><p>\n- <strong>Stemming and lemmatizing</strong> both of these processes try to consolidate words like \"laughs\" and \"laughing\" to  \"laugh\" since they all mean essentially the same thing, they are just inflected differently. So again, in an attempt to reduce the number of words, and get a realistic understanding of the meaning of a text, these words are collapsed. Stemming does this by cutting off the end (very fast), lemmatizing does this by looking up the dictionary form (very slow).</p><p>\nLanguage is messy, and created for and by people, not computers. There is a lot of grammatical information in a sentence that a computer cannot use. For example, I could say to you:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The house is burning.</p><p>\nand you would understand me. You would also understand if I say</p><p>\nhouse burn.</p><p>\nThe first has more information about tense, and which house in particular, but the sentiment is the same either way.</p><p>\nIn going from the first sentence to the normalized words, we removed the stop words (<em>the</em> and <em>is</em>), and removed punctuation and case, and lemmatized what was left (<em>burning</em> becomes <em>burn</em>—though we might have stemmed this, its impossible to tell from the example). This results in what is essentially a \"bag of words,\" or a corpus of words without any structure. Because normalizing your text reduces the number of words (and therefore the number of dimensions in your data), and keeps only the words that contribute meaning to the document, this cleaning is usually desirable.</p><p>\nAgain, this will be covered more in depth in the Machine Learning Tutorial, but for the time being, we just need to know that there is \"clean\" and \"dirty\" versions of text data. Sometimes our questions are about the clean data, but sometimes our questions are in the \"dirt.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Words into numbers</h2>\n<p>In the next section, we are going to go through a series of methods that come built-in to NLTK that allow us to turn our words into numbers and visualizations. This is just scratching the surface, but should give you an idea of what is possible beyond just counting words.</p>",

Copy out the URL and paste it into the Firefox or Google Chrome search bar.</p><p>\nFinally, in the Jupyter Notebook file browser, find the notebook file and open it. It should be called <code>TextAnalysis.ipynb</code>. You will use this file for reference in case you get stuck in the next few sections, so keep it open.</p><p>\nReturn to the Jupyter Home Tab in your Browser (or Launch the Jupyter Notebook again), and start a New Python3 Notebook using the <code>New</code> button in the upper right corner.</p><p>\nEven though Jupyter Notebook doesn't force you to do so, it is very important to name your file, or you will end up later with a bunch of untitled files and you will have no idea what they are about. In the top left, click in the word <code>Untitled</code> and give your file a name such as \"intro_nltk\".</p><p>\nIn the first blank cell, type the following to import the NLTK library:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">nltk</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>Libraries</strong> are sets of instructions that Python can use to perform specialized functions. The Natural Language ToolKit (<code>nltk</code>) is one such library. As the name suggests, its focus is on language processing.</p><p>\nWe will also need the matplotlib library later on, so import it now:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">matplotlib</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p><code>matplotlib</code> is a library for making graphs. In the middle of this tutorial, we are going to make a dispersion plot of words in our texts.</p><p>\nFinally, because of a quirk of Jupyter notebooks, we need to specify that matplotlib should display its graphs in the notebook (as opposed to in a separate window), so we type this command (this is technically a Jupyter command, not Python):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">%</span><span class=\"n\">matplotlib</span> <span class=\"n\">inline</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>All three of these commands can be written in the same cell and run all at once (<code>Shift + Enter</code>) or in different cells.</p><p>\n<img alt=\"Image showing that the three lines given above can be written in a single cell in the Jupyter notebook, one after another\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/text-analysis/imports.png\"/></p><p>\nIf you don't see an error when you run the notebook—that is, if nothing happens—you can move on to the next step.</p><p>\nNext, we need to load all of the NLTK corpora into our program. Even though we downloaded them to our computer, we need to tell Python we want to use them.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">nltk.book</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The pre-loaded NLTK texts should appear again. These are preformatted data sets. We will still have to do some minor processing, but having the data in this format saves us a few steps. At the end of this tutorial, we will make our own corpus. This is a special type of python object specific to NLTK (it isn't a string, list, or dictionary). Sometimes it will behave like a string, and sometimes like a list of words. How it is behaving is noted for each function as we try it out.</p><p>\n<img alt='Image showing a second cell with the output of \"from nltk.book import *\"' src=\"/static/images/lessons/text-analysis/nltkbook.png\"/></p><p>\nLet's start by analyzing <em>Moby Dick</em>, which is <code>text1</code> for NLTK.</p>",

Our text is behaving like a string. As discussed in the <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/python\">Python tutorial LINK</a>, Python does not <em>evaluate</em> strings, so it just counts the number of characters on either side. By default, this is 25 characters on either side of our target word (including spaces).</p><p>\nIn the Jupyter Notebook, type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">concordance</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"whale\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The output shows us the 25 characters on either side of the word \"whale\" in <em>Moby Dick</em>. Let's try this with another word, \"love.\" Just replace the word \"whale\" with \"love,\" and we get the contexts in which Melville uses \"love\" in <em>Moby Dick</em>. <code>concordance</code> is used (behind the scenes) for several other functions, including <code>similar</code> and <code>common_contexts</code>.</p><p>\nLet's now see which words appear in similar contexts as the word \"love.\" NLTK has a built-in function for this as well: <code>similar</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">similar</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"love\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Behind the scenes, Python found all the contexts where the word \"love\" appears. It also finds similar environments, and then what words were common among the similar contexts. This gives a sense of what other words appear in similar contexts. This is somewhat interesting, but more interesting if we can compare it to something else. Let's take a look at another text. What about <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>? Let's see what words are similar to \"love\" in Jane Austen's writing. In the next cell, type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text2</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">similar</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"love\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>We can compare the two and see immediately that Melville and Austen use the word \"love\" differently.</p>\n<h2>Investigating \"lol\"</h2>\n<p>Let's expand from novels for a minute and take a look at the NLTK Chat Corpus. In chats, text messages, and other digital communication platforms, \"lol\" is exceedingly common. We know it doesn't simply mean \"laughing out loud\"—maybe the <code>similar</code> function can provide some insight into what it does mean.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text5</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">similar</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"lol\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The resulting list is a lot of greetings, indicating that \"lol\" probably has more of a <a href=\"http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100321840\">phatic function</a>. Phatic language is language primarily for communicating social closeness. Phatic words stand in contrast to semantic words, which contribute meaning to the utterance.</p><p>\nIf you are interested in this type of analysis, take a look at the <code>common_contexts</code> function in the <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/book/\">NLTK book</a> or in the <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/\">NLTK docs</a>.</p>",

Another metric we can use is to visualize where the words appear in the text. In the case of <em>Moby Dick</em>, we want to compare where \"whale\" and \"monster\" appear throughout the text. In this case, the text is functioning as a list of words, and will make a mark where each word appears, offset from the first word. We will <em>pass</em> this <em>function</em> a <em>list</em> of <em>strings</em> to plot. This will likely help us develop a visual of the story — where the whale goes from being a whale to being a monster to being a whale again.

Some relevant words are \"marriage,\" \"love,\" \"home,\" \"mother,\" \"husband,\" \"sister,\" and \"wife.\" Pick a few to compare. You can compare an unlimited number, but it's easier to read a few at a time.

            "text": "<p>We will now turn our attention away from the NLTK library and work with our text using the built-in Python functions—the ones that come included with the Python language, rather than the NLTK library.</p>\n<h2>Types vs. tokens</h2>\n<p>First, let's find out how many times a given word appears in the corpus. In this case (and all cases going forward), our text will be treated as a list of words. Therefore, we will use the <code>count</code> function. We could just as easily do this with a text editor, but performing this in Python allows us to save it to a variable and then utilize this statistic in other calculations (for example, if we want to know what percentage of words in a corpus are 'lol', we would need a count of the 'lol's). In the next cell, type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">count</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"whale\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>We see that \"whale\" occurs 906 times, but that seems a little low. Let's check on \"Whale\" and see how often that appears:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">count</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Whale\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>\"Whale\" with a capital \"W\" appears 282 times. This is a problem for us—we actually want them to be collapsed into one word, since \"whale\" and \"Whale\" really are the same for our purposes. We will deal with that in a moment. For the time being, we will accept that we have two entries for \"whale.\"</p><p>\nThis gets at a distinction between <strong>type</strong> and <strong>token</strong>. \"Whale\" and \"whale\" are different types (as of now) because they do not match identically. Every instance of \"whale\" in the corpus is another <strong>token</strong>—it is an instance of the type, \"whale.\" Therefore, there are 906 tokens of \"whale\" in our corpus.</p><p>\nLet's fix this by making all of the words lowercase. We will make a new list of words, and call it \"text1_tokens\". We will fill this list with all the words in text1, but in their lowercase form. Python has a built-in function, <code>lower()</code> that takes all letters and makes them lowercase. In this same step, we are going to do a kind of tricky move, and only keep the words that are alphabetical and pass over anything that is punctuation or numbers. There is a built-in function, <code>isalpha()</code>, that will allow us to save only those words that are made of letters. If <code>isalpha()</code> is true, we'll make the word lowercase, and keep the word. If not, we'll pass over it and move to the next one.</p><p>\nType the following code into a new cell in your notebook. Pay special attention to the indentation, which must appear as below. (Note that in Jupyter Notebook, indentation usually comes automatically. If not, make sure to type the <code>space</code> key 4 times)</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isalpha</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lower</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p><img alt=\"image with code above in a jupyter notebook cell\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/text-analysis/for_loop_tokens.png\"/></p><p>\nAnother way to perform the same action more tersely is to use what's called a <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions\">list comprehension</a>. A list comprehension is a shorter, faster way to write a for-loop. It is syntactically a little more difficult to read (for a human), but, in this case, it's much faster to process. Don't worry too much about understanding the syntax of list comprehensions right now. For every example, we will show both the for loop and list comprehension options.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lower</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text1</span> <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isalpha</span><span class=\"p\">()]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Great! Now <code>text1_tokens</code> is a list of all of the tokens in our corpus, with the punctuation removed, and all the words in lowercase.</p><p>\nNow we want to know how many words there are in our corpus—that is, how many tokens in total. Therefore, we want to ask, \"What is the length of that list of words?\" Python has a built-in <code>len</code> function that allows you to find out the length of many types. Pass it a list, and it will tell you how many items are in the list. Pass it a string, and it will tell you how many characters are in the string. Pass it a dictionary, and it will tell you how many items are in the dictionary. In the next cell, type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Just for comparison, check out how many words were in \"text1\"—before we removed the punctuation and the numbers.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>We see there are over 218,000 words in <em>Moby Dick</em> (including metadata). But this is the number of words total—we want to know the number of unique words. That is, we want to know how many <em>types</em>, not just how many tokens.</p><p>\nIn order to get unique words, rather than just all words in general, we will make a <strong>set</strong> from the list. A <code>set</code> in Python work just like it would <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)\">in math</a>, it's all the unique values, with any duplicate items removed.</p><p>\nSo let's find out the length of our set. just like in math, we can also nest our functions. So, rather than saying <code>x = set(text1_tokens)</code> and then finding the length of \"x\", we can do it all in one step.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Great! Now we can calculate the <strong>lexical density</strong> of <em>Moby Dick</em>. <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c2a8/56959d7f5880c98ccd4cfeb4b4f5b7133ec7.pdf\">Statistical studies</a> have shown that lexical density (the number of unique words per total words) is a good metric to approximate lexical diversity—the range of vocabulary an author uses. For our first pass at lexical density, we will simply divide the number of unique words by the total number of words:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If we want to use this metric to compare texts, we immediately notice a problem. Lexical density is dependent upon the length of a text and therefore is strictly a comparative measure. It is possible to compare 100 words from one text to 100 words from another, but because language is finite and repetitive, it is not possible to compare 100 words from one to 200 words from another. Even with these restrictions, lexical density is a useful metric in grade level estimations, <a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/2226-471X/2/3/7\">vocabulary use</a> and genre classification, and a reasonable proxy for lexical diversity.</p><p>\nLet's take this constraint into account by working with only the first 10,000 words of our text. First we need to slice our list, returning the words in position 0 to position 9,999 (we'll actually write it as \"up to, but not including\" 10,000).</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1_slice</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"mi\">10000</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now we can do the same calculation we did above:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_slice</span><span class=\"p\">))</span> <span class=\"o\">/</span> <span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_slice</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This is a much higher number, though the number itself is arbitrary. When comparing different texts, this step is essential to get an accurate measure.</p>",

The way we can write this in Python is:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1_stops</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"ow\">not</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">stops</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">text1_stops</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>A faster option, if you are feeling bold, would be using <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions\">list comprehensions</a>: </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1_stops</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span> <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"ow\">not</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">stops</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>To check the result:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_stops</span><span class=\"p\">[:</span><span class=\"mi\">30</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<h3>Verifying List Contents</h3>\n<p>Now that we removed our stop words, let's see how many words are left in our list:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_stops</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>You should get a much lower number.</p><p>\nFor reference, let's also check how many unique words there are. We will do this by making a set of words. Sets are the same in Python as they are in math, they are all of the unique words rather than all the words. So, if \"whale\" appears 200 times in the list of words, it will only appear once in the set.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_stops</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Lemmatizing Words</h2>\n<p>Now that we've removed the stop words from our corpus, the next step is to stem or lemmatize the remaining words. This means that we will strip off the grammatical structure from the words. For example, <code>cats —&gt; cat</code>, and <code>walked —&gt; walk</code>. If that was all we had to do, we could stem the corpus and achieve the correct result, because stemming (as the name implies) really just means cutting off affixes to find the root (or the stem). Very quickly, however, this gets complicated, such as in the case of <code>men —&gt; man</code> and <code>sang —&gt; sing</code>. Lemmatization deals with this by looking up the word in a reference and finding the appropriate root (though note that this still is not entirely accurate). Lemmatization, therefore, takes a relatively long time, since each word must be looked up in a reference. NLTK comes with pre-built stemmers and lemmatizers.</p><p>\nWe will use the WordNet Lemmatizer from the NLTK Stem library, so let's import that now:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">nltk.stem</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">WordNetLemmatizer</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Because of the way that it is written \"under the hood,\" an instance of the lemmatizer needs to be called. We know this from reading <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/\">the docs</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">wordnet_lemmatizer</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">WordNetLemmatizer</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Let's quickly see what lemmatizing does.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">wordnet_lemmatizer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lemmatize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"children\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now try this one:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">wordnet_lemmatizer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lemmatize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"better\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>It didn't work, but...</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">wordnet_lemmatizer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lemmatize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"better\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">pos</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">'a'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>... sometimes we can get better results if we define a specific part of speech(pos). \"a\" is for \"adjective\", as we learned <a href=\"http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/corpus/reader/wordnet.html\">here</a>.</p><p>\nNow we will lemmatize the words in the list.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1_clean</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text1_stops</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">t_lem</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">wordnet_lemmatizer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lemmatize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">text1_clean</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t_lem</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>And again, there is a faster version for you to use once you feel comfortable with list comprehensions:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1_clean</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">wordnet_lemmatizer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lemmatize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text1_stops</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<h3>Verifying Clean List Contents</h3>\n<p>Let's check now to see the length of our final, cleaned version of the data, and then check the unique set of words. Notice how we will use the <code>print</code> function this time. Jupyter Notebook does print commands without the <code>print</code> function, but it will only print one thing per cell (the last command), and we wanted to print two different things:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_clean</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_clean</span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If everything went right, you should have the same length as before, but a smaller number of unique words. That makes sense since we did not remove any word, we only changed some of them.</p><p>\nNow if we were to calculate lexical density, we would be looking at how many word stems with semantic content are represented in <em>Moby Dick</em>, which is a different question than the one in our first analysis of lexical density.</p><p>\nWhy don't you try that by yourself? Try to remember how to calculate lexical density without looking back first. It is ok if you have forgotten.</p><p>\nNow let's have a look at the words Melville uses in <em>Moby Dick</em>. We'd like to look at all of the <em>types</em>, but not necessarily all of the <em>tokens.</em> We will order this set so that it is in an order we can handle. In the next cell, type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">sorted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_clean</span><span class=\"p\">))[:</span><span class=\"mi\">30</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p><code>Sorted</code> + <code>set</code> should give us a list of list of all the words in <em>Moby Dick</em> in alphabetical order, but we only want to see the first ones. Notice how there are some words we wouldn't have expected, such as 'abandon', 'abandoned', 'abandonedly', and 'abandonment'. This process is far from perfect, but it is useful. However, depending on your goal, a different process, like <code>stemming</code> might be better. </p>\n<h2>Stemming Words</h2>\n<p>The code to implement this and view the output is below:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">nltk.stem</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">PorterStemmer</span>\n<span class=\"n\">porter_stemmer</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">PorterStemmer</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The Porter is the most common Stemmer. Let's see what stemming does to words and compare it with lemmatizers:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">porter_stemmer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">stem</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'berry'</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">porter_stemmer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">stem</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'berries'</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">wordnet_lemmatizer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lemmatize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"berry\"</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">wordnet_lemmatizer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lemmatize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"berries\"</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Stemmer doesn't look so good, right? But how about checking how stemmer handles some of the words that our lemmatized \"failed\" us?</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">porter_stemmer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">stem</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'abandon'</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">porter_stemmer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">stem</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'abandoned'</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">porter_stemmer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">stem</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'abandonedly'</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">porter_stemmer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">stem</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'abandonment'</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Still not perfect, but a bit better. So the question is, how to choose between stemming and lemmatizing? As many things in text analysis, that depends. The best way to go is experimenting, seeing the results and chosing the one that better fits your goals.</p><p>\nAs a general rule, stemming is faster while lemmatizing is more accurate (but not always, as we just saw). For academics, usually the choice goes for the latter.</p><p>\nAnyway, let's stem our text with the Porter Stemmer:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">t1_porter</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text1_clean</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">t_stemmed</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">porter_stemmer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">stem</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">t1_porter</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t_stemmed</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Or, if we want a faster way:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">t1_porter</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">porter_stemmer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">stem</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text1_clean</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>And let's check the results:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t1_porter</span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">sorted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t1_porter</span><span class=\"p\">))[:</span><span class=\"mi\">30</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>A very different list of words is produced. This list is shorter than the list produced by the lemmatizer, but is also less accurate, and some of the words will completely change their meaning (like 'berry' becoming 'berri').</p>\n<h2>Back to the Lemmatized text</h2>\n<p>Now that we've seen some of the differences between both, we will proceed using our lemmatized corpus, which we saved as \"text1_clean\":</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">my_dist</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">FreqDist</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_clean</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If nothing happened, that is normal. Check to make sure it is there by calling for the type of the \"my_dist\" object.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">type</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">my_dist</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The result should say it is a nltk probability distribution (<code>nltk.probability.FreqDist</code>). It doesn't matter too much right now what that is, only that it worked. We can now plot this with the matplotlib function, <code>plot</code>. We want to plot the first 20 entries of the my_dist object.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">my_dist</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">plot</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p><img alt=\"nltk plot distribution\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/text-analysis/nltk_plot.png\"/></p><p>\nWe've made a nice image here, but it might be easier to comprehend as a list. Because this is a special probability distribution object we can call the <code>most_common</code> on this, too. Let's find the twenty most common words:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">my_dist</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">most_common</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>What about if we are interested in a list of specific words—perhaps to identify texts that have biblical references. Let's make a (short) list of words that might suggest a biblical reference and see if they appear in <em>Moby Dick</em>. Set this list equal to a variable:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">b_words</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s1\">'god'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">'apostle'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">'angel'</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Then we will loop through the words in our cleaned corpus, and see if any of them are in our list of biblical words. We'll then save into another list just those words that appear in both.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">my_list</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">word</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">b_words</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">word</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text1_clean</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">my_list</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">word</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">else</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">pass</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>And then we will print the results.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">my_list</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>You can obviously do this with much larger lists and even compare entire novels if you wish, though it would take a while with this approach. You can use this to get similarity measures and answer related questions.</p>",

            "text": "<p>Now that we have seen and implemented a series of text analysis techniques, let's go to the Internet to find a new text. You could use something such as historic newspapers, or Supreme Court proceedings, or use any txt file on your computer. Here we will use <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org\">Project Gutenberg</a>. Project Gutenberg is an archive of public domain written works, available in a wide variety of formats, including .txt. You can download these to your computer or access them via the url. We'll use the url method. We found <em>Don Quixote</em> in the archive, and will work with that.</p><p>\nThe Python package, urllib, comes installed with Python, but is inactive by default, so we still need to import it to utilize the functions. Since we are only going to use the urlopen function, we will just import that one.</p><p>\nIn the next cell, type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">urllib.request</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">urlopen</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The <code>urlopen</code> function allows your program to interact with files on the internet by opening them. It does not read them, however—they are just available to be read in the next line. This is the default behavior any time a file is opened and read by Python. One reason is that you might want to read a file in different ways. For example, if you have a <strong>really</strong> big file—think big data—you might want to read line-by-line rather than the whole thing at once.</p><p>\nNow let's specify which URL we are going to use. Though you might be able to find <em>Don Quixote</em> in the Project Gutenberg files, please type this in so that we are all using the same format (there are multiple .txt files on the site, one with utf-8 encoding, another with ascii encoding). We want the utf-8 encoded one. The difference between these is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but you can check out this <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding\">introduction to character encoding</a> from The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) if you are interested.</p><p>\nSet the URL we want to a variable:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">my_url</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/996/996-0.txt\"</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>We still need to open the file and read the file. You will have to do this with files stored locally as well. (in which case, you would type the path to the file (i.e., <code>data/texts/mytext.txt</code>) in place of <code>my_url</code>)</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">file</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">urlopen</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">my_url</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">raw</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">file</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">read</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This file is in bytes, so we need to decode it into a string. In the next cell, type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">don</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">raw</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">decode</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now let's check on what kind of object we have in the \"don\" variable. Type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">type</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">don</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This should be a string. Great! We have just read in our first file and now we are going to transform that string into a text that we can perform NLTK functions on. Since we already imported nltk at the beginning of our program, we don't need to import it again, we can just use its functions by specifying <code>nltk</code> before the function. The first step is to tokenize the words, transforming the giant string into a list of words. A simple way to do this would be to split on spaces, and that would probably be fine, but we are going to use the NLTK tokenizer to ensure that edge cases are captured (i.e., \"don't\" is made into 2 words: \"do\" and \"n't\"). In the next cell, type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">don_tokens</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">nltk</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">word_tokenize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">don</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>You can check out the type of <code>don_tokens</code> using the <code>type()</code> function to make sure it worked—it should be a list. Let's see how many words there are in our novel:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">don_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Since this is a list, we can look at any slice of it that we want. Let's inspect the first ten words:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">don_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">[:</span><span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>That looks like metadata—not what we want to analyze. We will strip this off before proceeding. If you were doing this to many texts, you would want to use <a href=\"https://regexone.com/\">Regular Expressions</a>. Regular Expressions are an extremely powerful way to match text in a document. However, we are just using this text, so we could either guess, or cut and paste the text into a text reader and identify the position of the first content (i.e., how many words in is the first word). That is the route we are going to take. We found that the content begins at word 315, so let's make a slice of the text from word position 315 to the end.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">dq_text</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">don_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">315</span><span class=\"p\">:]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Finally, if we want to use the NLTK specific functions:</p><p>\n- <code>concordance</code></p><p>\n- <code>similar</code></p><p>\n- <code>dispersion_plot</code></p><p>\n- or others from the <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/book/\">NLTK book</a></p><p>\nwe would have to make a specific NLTK <code>Text</code> object.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">dq_nltk_text</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">nltk</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Text</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dq_text</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If we wanted to use the built-in Python functions, we can just stick with our list of words in <code>dq_text</code>.

            "text": "<p><em>Note that we are going to use the pre-cleaned, <code>dq_text</code> object for this section.</em></p><p>\nPOS tagging is going through a text and identifying which part of speech each word belongs to (i.e., Noun, Verb, or Adjective). Every word belongs to a part of speech, but some words can be confusing.</p><p>\n- Floyd is happy.</p><p>\n- Happy is a state of being.</p><p>\n- Happy has five letters.</p><p>\n- I'm going to Happy Cat tonight.</p><p>\nTherefore, part of speech is as much related to the word itself as its relationship to the words around it. A good part-of-speech tagger takes this into account, but there are some impossible cases as well:</p><p>\n- Wanda was entertaining last night.</p><p>\nPart of Speech tagging can be done very simply: with a very small <em>tag set</em>, or in a very complex way: with a much more elaborate tag set. We are going to implement a compromise, and use a neither small nor large tag set, the <a href=\"https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html\">Penn Tree Bank POS Tag Set</a>.</p><p>\nThis is the tag set that is pre-loaded into NLTK. When we call the tagger, we expect it to return an object with the word and the tag associated. Because POS tagging is dependent upon the stop words, we have to use a text that includes the stop words. Therefore, we will go back to using the <code>dq_text</code> object for this section. Let's try it out. Type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">dq_tagged</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">nltk</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">pos_tag</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dq_text</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Let's inspect what we have:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dq_tagged</span><span class=\"p\">[:</span><span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This is a list of ordered tuples. (A tuple is like a list, but can't be changed once it is created.) Each element in the list is a pairing of <code>(word, POS-tag)</code>. (Tuples are denoted with parentheses, rather than square brackets.) This is great, but it is very detailed. I would like to know how many Nouns, Verbs, and Adjectives I have. </p><p>\nFirst, I'll make an empty dictionary to hold my results. Then I will go through this list of tuples and count the number of times each tag appears. Every time I encounter a new tag, I'll add it to a dictionary and then increment by one every time I encounter that tag again. Let's see what that looks like in code:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">tag_dict</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">{}</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># For every word/tag pair in my list,</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">word</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">tag</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">dq_tagged</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">tag</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">tag_dict</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">tag_dict</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">tag</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"o\">+=</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">else</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">tag_dict</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">tag</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now let's see what we got:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">tag_dict</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This would be better with some order to it, but dictionaries are made to be unordered. When we google \"sort dictionaries python\" we find a solution in our great friend <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/613218\">stack overflow</a>. Even though we cannot sort a dictionary, we can get a representation of a dictionary that is sorted. Don't worry too much about understanding the following code, as it uses things we have not discussed, and are out of the scope of this course. It is useful to see how we can reuse pieces of code even when we don't fully understand them.</p><p>\nNow let's do it and find out what the most common tag is.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">tag_dict_sorted</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">sorted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">tag_dict</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">items</span><span class=\"p\">(),</span>\n             <span class=\"n\">reverse</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">True</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n             <span class=\"n\">key</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">lambda</span> <span class=\"n\">kv</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">kv</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">tag_dict_sorted</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now check out what we have. It looks like NN is the most common tag. We can look up what NN means in the <a href=\"https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html\">Penn Tree Bank</a>. Looks like NN is a Noun, singular or mass. Great! This information will likely help us with genre classification, or identifying the author of a text, or a variety of other functions.</p>",

Whether that involves avoiding them as much as possible or constantly testing new software, we likely have some ideas about how we feel comfortable getting things done. How would you show a person who had never seen a computer, say [Kimmy Schmidt](https://youtu.be/LIdFa1qLgNQ) or [Brendan Fraser in *Blast from the Past*](https://youtu.be/Xq29uTtKW4M), how to *do* something on your computer?\nMany of us would explain what a screen and a cursor are, and then show how to point and click on icons. This approach relies on a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced \"gooey!\").\nToday we're going to explore another way to make your computer do things: through the command line. Instead of pointing and clicking, we'll be typing in either git bash (Windows) or terminal (macOS) to tell the computer directly what task we'd like it to perform.\nWhile this new technique can seem intimidating if you haven't used text-based interfaces before, luckily, you can use 90% of the functionality of the command line by becoming comfortable with a very small set of the most common commands.",

In practice, you can use these terms interchangeably. (If you're curious, though, you can read more about them <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/master/sections/command-line.md\">in the glossary</a>.) The shell we use (whether terminal, shell, or bash) is a program that accepts commands as text input and converts commands into appropriate operating system functions.</p><p>\nThe command line (of computers today) receives these commands as text that is typed in.</p>\n<h2>What does \"text-based\" mean?</h2>\n<p>For those of us comfortable reading and writing, the idea of \"text-based\" in the context of computers can seem a bit strange. As we start to get comfortable typing commands to the computer, it's important to distinguish \"text\" from word processed, desktop publishing (think Microsoft Word or Google Docs) in which we use software that displays what we want to produce without showing us the code the computer is reading to render the formatting. Plain text has the advantage of being manipulable in different contexts.</p><p>\nLet's take a quick moment to discuss text and text editors.</p>",

            "text": "<h2>What is text?</h2>\n<p>Before we explain which program we'll be using for editing text, we want to give a general sense of this \"text\" we keep mentioning. For those of us in the humanities, whether we follow literary theorists who read any object as a \"text\" or we dive into philology, paleography, codicology or any of the fields <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Greetham_(textual_scholar)\">David Greetham</a> lays out in <em>Textual Scholarship</em>, \"text\" has its specific meanings. As scholars working with computers, we need to be aware of the ways plain text and formatted text differ. Words on a screen may have hidden formatting. Many of us grew up using Microsoft Word and don't realize how much is going on behind the words shown on the screen. For the purposes of communicating with the computer and for easier movement between different programs, we need to use text without hidden formatting.</p><p>\n<img alt=\"Word Doc\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/command-line/worddoc.png\"/></p><p>\nUsers with visual disabilities, <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/command-line/blob/v2.0-smorello-edits/WordProcessorExample.docx?raw=true\">click here</a> to dowload the Word file.</p><p>\nIf you ask the command line to read that file, this Word .docx file will look something like this</p><p>\n<img alt=\"Word Doc as visualized by Command Line\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/command-line/CatWordDoc.png\"/></p><p></p><p>\nUsers with visual disabilities, <a href=\"PK.md\">click here</a> to dowload the text file.</p><p>\nWord documents which look like \"just words!\" are actually comprised of an archive of extensible markup language (XML) instructions that only Microsoft Word can read. Plain text files can be opened in a number of different editors and can be read within the command line.</p>\n<h2>Plain text</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of communicating with machines and between machines, we need characters to be as flexible as possible. Plain text include characters of readable material but not graphical representation.</p><p>\nAccording to the <a href=\"https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.1.0/\">Unicode Standard</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Plain text is a pure sequence of character codes; plain Unicode-encoded text is therefore a sequence of Unicode character codes.</p><p>\nPlain text has two main properties in regard to rich text:</p><p>\nplain text is the underlying content stream to which formatting can be applied. Plain text is public, standardized, and universally readable.</p><p>\nPlain text shows its cards—if it's marked up, the markup will be human readable. Plain text can be moved between programs more fluidly and can respond to programmatic manipulations. Because it is not tied to a particular font or color or placement, plain text can be styled externally.</p><p>\nA counterpoint to plain text is rich text (sometimes denoted by the Microsoft rich text format .rtf file extension) or \"enriched text\" (sometimes seen as an option in email programs). In rich text files, plain text is elaborated with formatting specific to the program in which they are made.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Choosing a text editor</h2>\n<p>An important tool for programming and working in the command line is a text editor. A text editor is a program that allows you to edit plain text files, such as .txt, .csv, or .md. Text editors are not used to edit rich text documents, such as .docx or .rtf, and rich text editors should not be used to edit plain text files. This is because rich text editors will add many invisible special characters that will prevent programs from running and configuration files from being read correctly.</p><p>\nWhile it doesn't really matter which text editor you choose, you should try to become comfortable with at least one text editor.</p><p>\nChoosing a text editor has as much to do with personality as it does with functionality. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs), user options, and \"hackability\" vary from program to program.</p>\n<h2>Default recommendation</h2>\n<p>For our workshops, we will be using <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a>. Not only is Visual Studio Code free and open source, but it is also consistent across OSX, Windows, and Linux systems.</p><p>\nYou will have downloaded VS Code according to the <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/vscode.md\">instructions</a> on the installations page. We won't be using the editor a lot in this tutorial, so don't worry about getting to know the editor now. In later workshops we will discuss syntax highlighting and version control, which Visual Studio Code supports. For now we will get back to working in the command line itself.</p>",

Keep this in mind today, this week, and your whole life. If at first something doesn't work, check your spelling! Unlike in human reading, where letters operate simultaneously as atomistic symbols and as complex contingencies (check <a href=\"https://genius.com/Johanna-drucker-from-a-to-screen-annotated\">Johanna Drucker</a> on the alphabet), in coding, each character has a discrete function including (especially!) spaces.</p><p>\nKeep in mind that the command line and file systems on macOS and Unix are usually pre-configured as cAsE-pReSeRvInG—so capitalizations also matter when typing commands and file and folder names.</p><p>\nAlso, while copying and pasting from this handy tutorial may be tempting to avoid spelling errors and other things, we encourage you not to! Typing out each command will help you remember them and how they work.</p>\n<h3>Getting started: know thyself</h3>\n<p>You may also see your username to the left of the command prompt <code>$</code>. Let's try our first command. Type the following and press the <code>enter</code> key:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> whoami\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The <code>whoami</code> command should print out your username. Congrats, you've executed your first command! This is a basic pattern of use in the command line: type a command, press <code>enter</code> on your keyboard, and receive output.</p>\n<h2>Orienting yourself in the command line: folders</h2>\n<p>OK, we're going to try another command. But first, let's make sure we understand some things about how your computer's filesystem works.</p><p>\nYour computer's files are organized in what's known as a hierarchical filesystem. That means there's a top level or \"root\" folder on your system. That folder has other folders in it, and those folders have folders in them, and so on. You can draw these relationships in a tree:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">Users</span>\n<span class=\"o\">|</span>\n <span class=\"err\">——</span> <span class=\"n\">your</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">username</span>\n   <span class=\"o\">|</span>\n    <span class=\"err\">——</span> <span class=\"n\">Applications</span>\n    <span class=\"err\">——</span> <span class=\"n\">Desktop</span>\n    <span class=\"err\">——</span> <span class=\"n\">Documents</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The root or highest-level folder on macOS is just called <code>/</code>. We won't need to go in there, though, since that's mostly just files for the operating system. On Windows, the root directory is usually called <code>C:</code> (<a href=\"http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2015/04/c-drive-default-windows-based-computers-2/\">More on why C is default on Windows</a>).</p><p>\nNote that we are using the word \"directory\" interchangeably with \"folder\"—they both refer to the same thing.</p><p>\nOK, let's try a command that tells us where we are in the filesystem:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> <span class=\"nb\">pwd</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>You should get output like <code>/Users/your-username</code>. That means you're in the <code>your-username</code> directory in the <code>Users</code> folder inside the <code>/</code> or root directory. On Windows, your output would instead be <code>C:/Users/your-username</code>. The folder you're in is called the working directory, and <code>pwd</code> stands for \"print working directory.\"</p><p>\nThe command <code>pwd</code> won't actually print anything except on your screen. This command is easier to grasp when we interpret \"print\" as \"display.\"</p><p>\nOK, we know where we are. But what if we want to know what files and folders are in the <code>your-username</code> directory, a.k.a. the working directory?</p><p>\nTry entering:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> ls\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>You should see a number of folders, probably including <code>Documents</code>, <code>Desktop</code>, and so on. You may also see some files. These are the contents of the current working directory. <code>ls</code> will \"list\" the contents of the directory you are in.</p><p>\nWonder what's in the Desktop folder? Let's try navigating to it with the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> <span class=\"nb\">cd</span> Desktop\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The <code>cd</code> command lets us \"change directory.\" (Make sure the \"D\" in \"Desktop\" is capitalized.) If the command was successful, you won't see any output. This is normal—often, the command line will succeed silently.</p><p>\nSo how do we know it worked? That's right, let's use our <code>pwd</code> command again. We should get:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> <span class=\"nb\">pwd</span>\n<span class=\"go\">/Users/your-username/Desktop</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now try <code>ls</code> again to see what's on your desktop. These three commands—<code>pwd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>cd</code>—are the most commonly used in the terminal. Between them, you can orient yourself and move around.</p><p>\nBefore we move on, let's take a minute to navigate through our computer's file system using the command line.</p>\n<h3>Compare with the GUI</h3>\n<p>It's important to note that this is the same old information you can get by pointing and clicking displayed to you in a different way.</p><p>\nGo ahead and use pointing and clicking to navigate to your working directory—you can get there a few ways, but try starting from \"My Computer\" and clicking down from there. You'll notice that the folder names should match the ones that the command line spits out for you, since it's the same information! We're just using a different mode of navigation around your computer to see it.</p>\n<hr/>",

Let's use a command that creates something on the computer.</p><p>\nFirst, make sure you're in the home directory:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> <span class=\"nb\">pwd</span>\n<span class=\"go\">/Users/your-username</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Let's move to the Desktop folder, or \"change directory\" with <code>cd</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"go\">cd Desktop</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Once you've made sure you're in the Desktop folder with <code>pwd</code>, let's try a new command:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"go\">touch foo.txt</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If the command succeeds, you won't see any output. Now move the terminal window and look at your \"real\" desktop, the graphical one. See any differences? If the command was successful and you were in the right place, you should see an empty text file called \"foo.txt\" on the desktop. Pretty cool, right?</p>\n<h2>Handy tip: up arrow</h2>\n<p>Let's say you liked that \"foo.txt\" file so much you'd like another! In the terminal window, press the \"up arrow\" on your keyboard. You'll notice this populates the line with the command that you just wrote. You can hit \"Enter\" to create another \"foo.txt,\" (note - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_(Unix)\"><code>touch</code></a> command will not overwrite your document nor will it add another document to the same directory, but it will update info about that file.) or you could use your left/right arrows to change the file name to \"foot.txt\" to create something different.</p><p>\nAs we start to write more complicated and longer commands in our terminal, the \"up arrow\" is a great shortcut so you don't have to spend lots of time typing.</p>\n<h2>Creating folders</h2>\n<p>OK, so we're going to be doing a lot of work during the Digital Research Institute. Let's create a project folder in our Desktop so that we can keep all our work in one place.</p><p>\nFirst, let's check to make sure we're still in the Desktop folder with <code>pwd</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> <span class=\"nb\">pwd</span>\n<span class=\"go\">/Users/your-username/Desktop</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Once you've double-checked you're in Desktop, we'll use the <code>mkdir</code> or \"make directory\" command to make a folder called \"projects\":</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"go\">mkdir projects</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now run <code>ls</code> to see if a projects folder has appeared. Once you confirm that the projects folder was created successfully, <code>cd</code> into it.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> <span class=\"nb\">cd</span> projects\n<span class=\"gp\">$</span> <span class=\"nb\">pwd</span>\n<span class=\"go\">/Users/your-username/Desktop/projects</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2>OK, now you've got a projects folder that you can use throughout the Institute. It should be visible on your graphical desktop, just like the <code>foo.txt</code> file we created earlier.</h2>",

            "text": "<p>In this section, we'll create a text file that we can use as a cheat sheet. You can use it to keep track of all the awesome commands you're learning.</p>\n<h2><code>Echo</code></h2>\n<p>Instead of creating an empty file like we did with <code>touch</code>, let's try creating a file with some text in it. But first, let's learn a new command: <code>echo</code></p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> <span class=\"nb\">echo</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Hello from the command line\"</span>\n<span class=\"go\">Hello from the command line</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Redirect (<code>&gt;</code>)</h2>\n<p>By default, the echo command just prints out the text we give it. Let's use it to create a file with some text in it:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"go\">echo \"This is my cheat sheet\" &gt; cheat-sheet.txt</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now let's check the contents of the directory:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> <span class=\"nb\">pwd</span>\n<span class=\"go\">/Users/your-username/projects</span>\n<span class=\"gp\">$</span> ls\n<span class=\"go\">cheat-sheet.txt</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>OK, so the file has been created. But what was the <code>&gt;</code> in the command we used? On the command line, a <code>&gt;</code> is known as a \"redirect.\" It takes the output of a command and puts it in a file. Be careful, since it's possible to overwrite files with the <code>&gt;</code> command.</p><p>\nIf you want to add text to a file but <em>not</em> overwrite it, you can use the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> command, known as the redirect and append command, instead. If there's already a file with text in it, this command can add text to the file <em>without</em> destroying and recreating it.</p>\n<h2><code>Cat</code></h2>\n<p>Let's check if there's any text in cheat-sheet.txt.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"go\">cat cheat-sheet.txt</span>\n<span class=\"go\">This is my cheat sheet</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>As you can see, the <code>cat</code> command prints the contents of a file to the screen. <code>cat</code> stands for \"concatenate,\" because it can link strings of characters or files together from end to end.</p>\n<h2>A note on file naming</h2>\n<p>Your cheat sheet is titled <code>cheat-sheet.txt</code> instead of <code>cheat sheet.txt</code> for a reason. Can you guess why?</p><p>\nTry to make a file titled <code>cheat sheet.txt</code> and report to the class what happens.</p><p>\nNow imagine you're attempting to open a very important data file using the command line that is titled <code>cheat sheet.txt</code></p><p>\nFor your digital best practices, we recommend making sure that file names contain no spaces—you can use creative capitalization, dashes, or underscores instead. Just keep in mind that the macOS and Unix file systems are usually pre-configured as cAsE-pReSeRvInG, which means that capitalization matters when you type commands to navigate between or do things to directories and files.</p>\n<h2>Using a text editor</h2>\n<p>The challenge for this section will be using a text editor, specifically Visual Studio Code (<a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/vscode.md\">install guide here</a>), to add some of the commands that we've learned to the newly created cheat sheet. Text editors are programs that allow you to edit plain text files, such as .txt, .py (Python scripts), and .csv (comma-separated values, also known as spreadsheet files). Remember not to use programs such as Microsoft Word to edit text files, since they add invisible characters that can cause problems.</p>\n<h1>Pipes</h1>\n<p>So far, you've learned a number of commands and one special symbol, the <code>&gt;</code> or redirect. Now we're going to learn another, the <code>|</code> or \"pipe.\"</p><p>\nPipes let you take the output of one command and use it as the input for another.</p><p>\nLet's start with a simple example:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> <span class=\"nb\">echo</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Hello from the command line\"</span> <span class=\"p\">|</span> wc -w\n<span class=\"go\">5</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>In this example, we take the output of the <code>echo</code> command (\"Hello from the command line\") and pipe it to the <code>wc</code> or word count command, adding a flag <code>-w</code> for number of words. The result is the number of words in the text that we entered.</p><p>\nLet's try another. What if we wanted to put the commands in our cheat sheet in alphabetical order?</p><p>\nUse <code>pwd</code> and <code>cd</code> to make sure you're in the folder with your cheat sheet. Then try:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"go\">cat cheat-sheet.txt | sort</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>You should see the contents of the cheat sheet file with each line rearranged in alphabetical order. If you wanted to save this output, you could use a <code>&gt;</code> to print the output to a file, like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"go\">cat cheat-sheet.txt | sort &gt; new-cheat-sheet.txt</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<h2><img alt=\"Pipes example\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/command-line/pipes.gif\"/></h2>\n<h1>Exploring text data</h1>\n<p>So far the only text file we've been working with is our cheat sheet. Now, this is where the command line can be a very powerful tool: let's try working with a large text file, one that would be too large to work with by hand.</p><p>\nLet's download the data we're going to work with:</p><p>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/command-line/blob/v2.0-smorello-edits/nypl_items.csv?raw=true\">Download nypl_items.csv</a></p><p>\nOur data set is a list of public domain items from the New York Public Library. It's in .csv format, which is a plain text spreadsheet format. CSV stands for \"comma separated values,\" and each field in the spreadsheet is separated with a comma. It's all still plain text, though, so we can manipulate the data using the command line.</p>\n<h2>Move command</h2>\n<p>Once the file is downloaded, move it from your <code>Downloads</code> folder to the <code>projects</code> folder on your desktop—either through the command line, or drag and drop in the GUI. Since this is indeed a command line workshop, you should try the former!</p><p>\nTo move this file using the command line, you first need to navigate to your <code>Downloads</code> folder where that file is saved. Then type the <code>mv</code> command followed by the name of the file you want to move and then the file path to your <code>projects</code> folder on your desktop, which is where you want to move that file to (note that <code>~</code> refers to your home folder):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"go\">mv nypl_items.csv ~/Desktop/projects/</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>You can then navigate to that <code>projects</code> folder and use the <code>ls</code> command to check that the file is now there.</p>\n<h2>Viewing data in the command line</h2>\n<p>Try using <code>cat</code> to look at the data. You'll find it all goes by too fast to get any sense of it. (You can click <code>Control</code> and <code>C</code> on your keyboard to cancel the output if it's taking too long.)</p><p>\nInstead, let's use another tool, the <code>less</code> command, to get the data one page at a time:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> less nypl_items.csv\n<span class=\"go\">...</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p><code>less</code> gives you a paginated view of the data; it will show you contents of a file or the output from a command or string of commands, page by page.</p><p>\nTo view the file contents page by page, you may use the following keyboard shortcuts (that should work on Windows using Git Bash or on macOS terminal):</p><p>\nClick the <code>f</code> key to view forward one page, or the <code>b</code> key to view back one page.</p><p>\nOnce you're done, click the <code>q</code> key to return to the command line.</p><p>\nLet's try two more commands for viewing the contents of a file:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> head nypl_items.csv\n<span class=\"go\">...</span>\n<span class=\"gp\">$</span> tail nypl_items.csv\n<span class=\"go\">...</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>These commands print out the very first (the \"head\") and very last (the \"tail\") sections of the file, respectively.</p>\n<h2>Interlude for a favorite command line feature: tab completion</h2>\n<p>When you are navigating in the command line, typing folder and file names can seem to go against the promise of easier communication with your computer. Here comes <code>tab</code> completion, stage right!</p><p>\nWhen you need to type out a file or folder name—for example, the name of that csv file we've been working with: nypl_items.csv—in the command line and want to move more quickly, you can just type out the beginning characters of that file name up until it's distinct in that folder and then click the <code>tab</code> key. And voilà! Clicking that <code>tab</code> key will complete the rest of that name for you, and it only works if that file or folder already exists within your working directory.</p><p>\nIn other words, anytime in the command line you can type as much of the file or folder name that is unique within that directory, and <code>tab</code> complete the rest!</p>\n<h2>Note: Clearing Text</h2>\n<p>If all the text remaining in your terminal window is starting to overwhelm you, you have some options. You may type the <code>clear</code> command into the command line, or click the <code>command</code> and <code>k</code> keys to clear the scrollback. In macOS terminal, clicking the <code>command</code> and <code>l</code> keys will clear the output from your most recent command.</p>\n<h2>Cleaning the data</h2>\n<p>We didn't tell you this before, but there are duplicate lines in our data! Two, to be exact. Before we try removing them, let's see how many entries are in our .csv file:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> cat nypl_items.csv <span class=\"p\">|</span> wc -l\n<span class=\"go\">100001</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This tells us there are 100,001 lines in our file. The <code>wc</code> tool stands for \"word count,\" but it can also count characters and lines in a file. We tell <code>wc</code> to count lines by using the <code>-l</code> flag. If we wanted to count characters, we could use <code>wc -m</code>. Flags marked with hyphens, such as <code>-l</code> or <code>-m</code>, indicate options which belong to specific commands. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/master/sections/command-line.md\">glossary</a> for more information about flags and options.</p><p>\nTo find and remove duplicate lines, we can use the <code>uniq</code> command. Let's try it out:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> cat nypl_items.csv <span class=\"p\">|</span> uniq <span class=\"p\">|</span> wc -l\n<span class=\"go\">99999</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>OK, the count went down by two because the <code>uniq</code> command removed the duplicate lines. But which lines were duplicated?</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> cat nypl_items.csv <span class=\"p\">|</span> uniq -d\n<span class=\"go\">...</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The <code>uniq</code> command with the <code>-d</code> flag prints out the lines that have duplicates.</p><p>\n<img alt=\"exploring data\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/command-line/data.gif\"/></p>\n<h1>Searching text data</h1>\n<p>So we've cleaned our data set, but how do we find entries that use a particular term?</p><p>\nLet's say I want to find all the entries in our data set that use the term \"Paris.\"</p><p>\nHere we can use the <code>grep</code> command. <code>grep</code> stands for \"global regular expression print.\" The <code>grep</code> command processes text line by line and prints any lines which match a specified pattern. Regular expressions are infamously human-illegible commands that use character by character matching to return a pattern. <code>grep</code> gives us access to the power of regular expressions as we search for text.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> cat nypl_items.csv <span class=\"p\">|</span> grep -i <span class=\"s2\">\"paris\"</span>\n<span class=\"go\">...</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will print out all the lines that contain the word \"Paris.\" (The <code>-i</code> flag makes the command ignore capitalization.) Let's use our <code>wc -l</code> command to see how many lines that is:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> cat nypl_items.csv <span class=\"p\">|</span> grep -i <span class=\"s2\">\"paris\"</span> <span class=\"p\">|</span> wc -l\n<span class=\"go\">191</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here we have asked <code>cat</code> to read nypl_items.csv, take the output and pipe it into the <code>grep -i</code> command, which will ignore capitalization and find all instances of the word \"paris.\" We then take the output of that <code>grep</code> command and pipe it into the word count <code>wc</code> command with the <code>-l</code> lines option. The pipeline returns <code>191</code> letting us know that Paris (or paris) occurs on 191 lines of our data set.</p>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Searching a text file with grep\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/command-line/grep.gif\"/></p>\n<h1>What we've learned</h1>\n<p>You've made it through your introduction to the command line! By now, you have experienced some of the power of communicating with your computer using text commands. The basic steps you learned today will help as you move forward through the week—you'll work with the command line interface to set up your <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git\">version control with git</a> and you'll have your text editor open while <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/python\">writing python scripts</a> and building basic websites with <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/html-css\">HTML and CSS</a>.</p><p>\nNow is a good time to do a quick review!</p><p>\nIn this session, we learned:</p><p>\n- how to use <code>touch</code> and <code>echo</code> to create files </p><p>\n- how to use <code>mkdir</code> to create folders</p><p>\n- how to navigate our file structure by <code>cd</code>(change directory), <code>pwd</code> (print working directory), and <code>ls</code> (list)</p><p>\n- how to use redirects (<code>&gt;</code>) and pipes (<code>|</code>) to create a pipeline</p><p>\n- how to explore a comma separated values (.csv) dataset using word and line counts, <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>, and the concatenate command <code>cat</code></p><p>\n- how to search text files using the <code>grep</code> command</p><p>\nAnd we made a <a href=\"12-commands.md\">cheat sheet</a> for reference!</p><p>\nWhen we started, we reviewed what text is—whether plain or enriched. We learned that text editors that don't fix formatting of font, color, and size, do allow for more flexible manipulation and multi-program use. If text is allowed to be a string of characters (and not specific characters chosen for their compliance with a designer's intention), that text can be fed through programs and altered with automated regularity. Text editors are different software than Bash (or Terminal), which is a text-based shell that allows you to interact directly with your operating system giving direct input and receiving output.</p><p>\nHaving a grasp of command line basics will not only make you more familiar with how your computer and basic programming work, but it will also give you access to tools and communities that will expand your research.</p>",

            "text": "<h2>What does \"done\" look like?</h2>\n<p>Most digital projects come to an end at some point, in one way or another. We either simply stop working on them, or we forget about them, or we move on to something else. Few digital projects have an end \"form\" in the way that we think of a monograph. We rarely think of digital scholarship in its \"done\" form, but sooner or later even if they're not \"finished\"—so to speak—at some point, these projects end. </p><p>\nDone can take many different shapes: \n* it can morph into something new;\n* it can be retired;\n* it can be archived in a repository;\n* it can be saved on some form of storage media;\n* it can run out of funding; \n* and sometimes <strong>you</strong> are done with it!</p><p>\nSo it's helpful to think about what you want \"done\" to look like before you begin, because then you always have a sense of what will make a satisfactory ending to the work you're about to embark on. </p>\n<h2>Activity</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Imagine what your project is like when it's over. Imagine what it means to you to set it down and walk away. What will you do with it? How will you know if it succeded? Who was the last person to care about it? Why? </li>\n<li>Now, Describe your 2-3 sentences to a non-expert audience the purpose of your project. </li>\n<li>Does it solve a problem? </li>\n<li>Meet an institutional need? </li>\n<li>Put an existing resource to new use?</p><p>\n # Identifying Audiences, Constituencies, and Collaborators</li>\n<li>Who will participate in, use, and/or benefit from the project? </li>\n<li>Is there a specific group already asking for this new resource? Who? </li>\n<li>The \"general public\" is too general an audience. the more specific your audience is the more likely you are to meet their needs. </li>\n<li>Is there anything that my audience can bring to my project?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Your project <strong>always</strong> has an audience.</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>You</em> are an audience. </li>\n<li>Your dissertation advisor</li>\n<li>Your dissertation committee</li>\n<li>Researchers interested in your subject area</li>\n<li>Researchers working on related questions</p><p>\n<em>Projects typically satisfy more than one audience's need. The key to identifying a well-defined audience is research and creating several narrow profiles</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sample 1:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Needs/Interest: Faculty who teach undergraduate linguistics classes are looking for an engaging way to teach fundamental linguistics concepts through guided practice and repetition. </li>\n<li>Resources: They have access to chrome books, laptops, and tablets in the classroom with limited wifi. They are unable to update software frequently, but they can use web applications. </li>\n<li>Limitations: This audience needs clear and specific documentation and has a low threshold for errors. </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Sample 2:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Needs/Interest: My dissertation committee is interested in hearing how my model of financial data offers a new approach to predicting corporate fraud. </li>\n<li>Resources/Relationship: The committee is familiar with some of the models that already exist. They have deep familiarity with the qualitative indicators for corporate fraud. They can connect my data and my research to a wider community of scholars who have the datasets that I need to finish my work. My advisor wants me to succeed. </li>\n<li>Limitations: My committee is skeptical about technology and feels uncertain about how they will evaluate my work. They have expressed concern about not knowing how to \"check\" if the model is accurate. </p><p>\nIf you are working on a project that is institutionally based (such as creating a platform, creating a resource, or building a teaching tool), you may have institutaional partners who have a stake in your project's success.  It's a good idea to identify these folks and consider their interests and needs as well. </p><p>\nPossible stakeholders include: your library, colleagues, IT division, academic program, a center, or institute who shares your mission and/or goals. </p><p>\nExample of a \"stakeholder\":</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Sample:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Needs: The New Media Lab has student fellows who develop digital projects. They have expressed interest in finding a data management tool that allows students to create a plan for how to handle various types of data files. </li>\n<li>Resources/Relationships: I'm also a fellow in the New Media Lab, and they might be willing to help test my tool. </li>\n<li>Limitations/Concessions: They are more interested in using open source software than many of the other students I work with. </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Activity: Your Turn</h2>\n<h3>Audience 1:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Needs/Interest: </li>\n<li>Resources/Relationship: </li>\n<li>Limitations/Concessions: </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Audience 2:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Needs/Interest: </li>\n<li>Resources/Relationship: </li>\n<li>Limitations/Concessions: </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Audience 3:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Needs/Interest: </li>\n<li>Resources/Relationship: </li>\n<li>Limitations/Concessions: </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Audience 4:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Needs/Interest: </li>\n<li>Resources/Relationship: </li>\n<li>Limitations/Concessions: </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Internal Stakeholder:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Needs/Interest: </li>\n<li>Resources/Relationship: </li>\n<li>Limitations/Concessions:</li>\n</ol>",

Sometimes, the planning process stops after the scan because you find that someone has already done it! Typically, a scan is useful in articulating and justifying the \"need\" for your research OR to justify your choice of one technology in lieu of others. Performing an environmental scan early and reviewing and revising it periodically will go a long way to help you prove that your project fills a current need for an actual audience. </p><p>\nSuccessful project proposals demonstrate knowledge of the ecosystem of existing projects in your field, and the field's response to those projects. Scans often help organizations identify potential collaborators, national intitiatives, publications, articles, or professional organizations, which in turn can demonstraate a wider exigency for your project. Following a preliminary scan, you should be able to explain why your project is important to the field, what it provides that does not currently exist, and how your project can serve as a leader or example to other organizations in such a way that they can put your findings to new issue. </p><p>\nBelow are <strong>suggestions</strong> for finding similar projects and initiatives in and outside of your field: </p>\n<h2>Federal grant agencies maintain repositories with white papers from previously funded grant projects:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Institute of Museum and Library Services</li>\n<li>National Endowment for the Humanities Funded Projects Query Form</li>\n<li>National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) Recent Grants </li>\n<li>National Science Foundation</li>\n<li>National Institutes of Health</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Search and browse through literature in the field and resources for digital tools and innovations.

This outline offers suggestions and lessons learned from successful and less successful collaborations. while each project is unique in the way responsibilities are shared, perhaps one universal attribute of successful partnerships is mutual respect. The most successful collaborations are characterized by a demonstrated respect for each partners's time, work, space, staff, or policies in words and actions. </p>\n<h2>Identify what you need:</h2>\n<p>Once you know where you need help, start thinking about who you know who might have those skills, areas of expertise, resources, and interest. \n* Partnerships should be selected on the basis of specific strengths. \n* If you don't know someone who fits the bill, can someone you know introduce you to someone you would like to know? What are some ways of finding someone with skills you don't have if you don't know anyone with those skills? </p>\n<h2>Find Collaborators:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Attending conferences and unconferences can be the best way to meet potential collaborators who share similar goals and passions. Informal gatherings are often the best place to chat with folks: “Birds of a Feather” dinners, or affinity group luncheons.</li>\n<li>Talk to a grant program office about your project; they may have some great recommendations.</li>\n<li>Circulate some ideas on your professional social networks to scope out potential partners.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Identify a good fit:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Talk with a potential collaborator. Introduce yourself by email and schedule a phone call. It’s very important to speak or meet face-to-face with potential collaborators before formalizing partnerships.</li>\n<li>Good partners share in the project’s vision and are committed to the project’s success.</li>\n<li>Good partners respect one another and appreciate what each one brings to the project.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Formalize partnerships:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Clearly state expectations of work in a written document or contract.</li>\n<li>Make sure each partner understands exactly what their contributions will be, when those contributions are due, and who else is responsible for other pieces.</li>\n<li>Be sure both/all parties are in agreement on issues such as:<ul>\n<li>who takes notes during meetings,</li>\n<li>who manages the budget,</li>\n<li>who is the “decider” on major project decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Determine who the primary contact for inter-institutional communications will be.</li>\n<li>Designate staff titles and responsibilities, including a description of job responsibilities over the life-cycle of the project.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Communicate Effectively:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Early on, establish communication norms: including regular meeting times, means for meeting (conference calls, Skype, Hangouts, et al), and best ways to communicating in between meetings (ie, email only), and collect all preferred contact information and publish it somewhere accessible to the entire team.</li>\n<li>Use project management software for organizing project tasks, deadline, deliverable requirements that makes all of this information easily accessible and visible to project collaborators.</li>\n<li>If working with geographically-dispersed collaborators, be sure to schedule face-to-face meetings at a reasonable, yet, regular interval.</li>\n<li>Generally, treat all project team members with respect and engage in common courtesies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Stay flexible:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>No project is able to anticipate all problems or challenges before they occur, but simply acknowledging that challenges may arise, and allowing time and budget for those challenges is helpful.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bad Marriages:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Not all collaborations work out as planned, even with the best of intentions.</li>\n<li>If there is a major breakdown in communications, or if relationships deteriorate, you may need to break apart partnerships.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Asking for letters of support</h2>\n<p>When preparing a proposal, you will need mentors, collaborators, or other interested parties to write a strong letter of support for your project that will help your proposal stand out to the reviewers.

Good letters demonstrate some knowledge of the project and recognition of its impact if funded. </p><p>\nFollow these steps when asking for a support letter and for specific types of assistance during the life of the grant, and you should receive a good letter in return.\n* One month before grant deadline, begin brainstorming candidates for letters of support and note which collaborators are required to submit letters of commitment and support. \n* Start asking supporters at least two weeks in advance of grant deadline, because they will also have deadlines and other work competing for their work hours. You may find some folks are on leave at the time you inquire, be sure to have back-ups on your list. \n* Email potential supporters, collaborators:</p><p>\n    * State why, specifically, you are asking Person A for support;</p><p>\n    * Be specific about what you are asking Person A to do over the scope of the grant, if anything, such as participate in 3 meetings, 2 phone calls over 18 months; or  agree to review the project and provide feedback one month before official launch; </p><p>\n    * Provide any information about compensation, especially when asking someone to participate (ie, there will be a modest honorarium to recognize the time you give to this project of $xxx);</p><p>\n    8 Tell supporters what exactly you need to complete the grant application, in what format, and by what date (ie, a 2-page CV in PDF and letter of support on letterhead by next Friday).\n* Attach materials that will be helpful for them when writing the letter.</p><p>\n    * Provide a short project summary that includes the project goals, deliverables, and work plan from the grant proposal draft;</p><p>\n    * Include a starter letter containing sample text that references that person’s or institution’s role and why they are supporting the project.</p>",

The following may prove useful: </p><p>\n        * The Foundation Center: [http://foundationcenter.org] (http://foundationcenter.org)</p><p>\n        * A Directory of State and Local Foundations: </p><p>\n        [http://foundationcenter.org/getstarted/topical/sl_dir.html] (http://foundationcenter.org/getstarted/topical/sl_dir.html)</p><p>\n        * The Council on Foundations Community Foundations List</p><p>\n     http://www.conf.org/whoweserve/community/resources/index.cfm?navitemNumber=15626#locator</p><p>\n     * The USDA offers a valuable Guide to Funding Resources [https://www.nal.usda.gov/ric/guide-to-funding-resources] (https://www.nal.usda.gov/ric/guide-to-funding-resources)</p><p>\n2. Check your institution’s eligibility for a potential grants before beginning the application process. Eligibility requirements and restrictions are often found in grant guidelines.</p><p>\n3. Review the types of projects this program funds, and consider how your project fits with the agency or foundation’s mission and strategic goals.</p><p>\n4. Review a potential grant program’s deadlines and requirements (including proposal requirements and format for submission).</p><p>\n5. Identify funding levels/maxes, and keep them close at hand as you develop your budget.</p><p>\n6.

This means we will be using Python in the terminal, which is a special space that allows us to run little bits of Python, experimenting and exploring what it can do, without having to save it. Think of this interactive space as a playground. Later on, we will be working with Python in a more robust way, doing what we call saving and executing Python scripts.</p><p>\nFor now, though, let's start an interactive session with Python, which is accessed through the terminal. </p><p>\nOpen your terminal and type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> python\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>at the prompt. You should see something like this</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"go\">Python 3.6.3 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Oct 13 2017, 12:02:49)</span>\n<span class=\"go\">[GCC 7.2.0] on Linux</span>\n<span class=\"go\">Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.</span>\n<span class=\"go\">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Unlike the normal <code>$</code> terminal prompt, the Python prompt looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"go\">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>These carrots are how you know that you have entered an interactive session with Python. Now you are interacting directly with Python, rather than in the regular terminal. Keep an eye on these carrots, as a common early source of confusion is entering terminal commands into the Python prompt or entering Python commands into the terminal.</p>\n<h2>A Little Math</h2>\n<p>Let's try a little math at the Python prompt. In the example below, type the text that appears after the Python prompt (the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>). The line below is the output that is returned. This will be a standard convention when giving examples using the Python prompt.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span>\n<span class=\"go\">5</span>\n<span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"mi\">14</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"mi\">10</span>\n<span class=\"go\">4</span>\n<span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"mi\">10</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">10</span>\n<span class=\"go\">100</span>\n<span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"mi\">6</span> <span class=\"o\">/</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span>\n<span class=\"go\">2</span>\n<span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"mi\">21</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"mi\">4</span>\n<span class=\"go\">1</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The first four operations above are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. The last operation is modulo, or mod, which returns the remainder after division.</p><p>\nNote the way you interact with Python at the prompt. After entering an expression such as <code>2 + 3</code>, Python \"evaluates\" it to a simpler form, <code>5</code>, and then prints out the answer for you. <strong>This process is called the Read Eval Print Loop, or REPL</strong>. Reading takes commands from you, the input is evaluated or run, the result is printed out, and the prompt is shown again to wait for more input. The normal terminal (the one with the <code>$</code>) is another example of a REPL. </p><p>\nThe REPL is useful for quick tests and, later, can be used for exploring and debugging your programs interactively. You might consider it a kind of playground for testing and experimenting with python expressions. </p>",

            "text": "<p>So far, you've interacted with Python one line at a time in the REPL. This is what we call the Interactive Mode, which is like a playground for experimenting and exploring different Python expressions,  like <code>2 + 2</code> or <code>type(\"some stuff\")</code>. The code that we write in the REPL is not saved after you exit, which means that this space is for running Python expressions and <em>not</em> for writing longer programs. </p><p>\nFor the rest of this session, we're going to expand beyond the REPL to write and execute longer programs. To do this, we will begin to work with text editor, where we write out longer Python scripts, and run those scripts from the terminal. </p><p>\nThis is a big move, so let's take it slow. The major change is that we will be working across two spaces, the terminal and the text editor, rather than just the terminal alone. We will be writing our scripts into the text editor, and using the terminal to run those scripts. </p>\n<h2>Your first script</h2>\n<p>First, let's begin with the text editor. Open your text editor of choice (such as VS Code) and create a new file with this line:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Hello world!\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Save it with the name <code>hello.py</code> to a known location, such as your desktop. Open your terminal and move to the desktop directory:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> <span class=\"nb\">cd</span> Desktop\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Once you're in the folder with your <code>hello.py</code> file, move to the terminal. Do <em>not</em> enter the Python Interactive Mode (the REPL), which is unecessary to run python scripts. Instead, lookout for the <code>$</code> symbol that lets you know you're in the terminal. If you find yourself in the Interactive mode (<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>), then exit it with <code>control-D</code>. You should see the <code>$</code> symbol, letting you know you're back in the terminal.</p><p>\nNow that you're in the terminal, type the following, and press enter:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> python hello.py\n<span class=\"go\">Hello world!</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>You should see the text <code>Hello world!</code> appear as output in the terminal window. </p><p>\nCongratulations! You've written your first script. That's kind of a big deal.</p><p>\nThere are a couple of important things to note here. First, it bears repeating that you are moving between two different spaces, the text editor and the terminal. You wrote your Python script in the text editor, and used the terminal to run the script. Second, within in the text editor, you included the <code>print()</code> function  because, unlike in the REPL, things aren't automatically printed out when writing scripts. When you're in the text editor, you always need to include the <code>print()</code> function so that your output will appear in the terminal. </p>\n<h2>A Note on Text</h2>\n<p>Fundamentally, Python programs are just text files. You can write them in any text editor, like VS Code or Notepad on Windows. When you pass the text file to Python, it runs the code in the file one line at a time. There's nothing special about <code>.py</code> files—they're just regular text files. This makes them work well with command line tools like Git. The tools you've learned so far—the command line, Git, markdown, grep—are all designed to work well together, and the medium through which they all work is plain text.</p>",

            "text": "<p>Our usual response when seeing an error on a computer screen is a stress response. Our heart rate elevates and, if we cannot do what we were asking the computer to do, our frustration mounts. This is because many errors when interacting with programs are not useful or informative, and because we often have no capability to fix the program in front of us.</p><p>\nIn Python, errors are our friends. This might be hard to accept initially, but the errors you see when running Python scripts generally do a good job of pointing you to what's going wrong in your program. When you see an error in Python, therefore, try not to fall into the stress response you may be used to when interacting with your computer normally.</p>\n<h2>Two kinds of errors</h2>\n<p>In Python, there are two kinds of errors you will encounter frequently. One appears before the program runs, and the other appears during the execution of a program.</p><p>\n<strong>syntax errors</strong> - When you ask Python to run a program or execute a line in the REPL, it will first check to see if the program is valid Python code—that is, that it follows the grammatical or syntactical rules of Python. If it doesn't, before the program even runs, you'll see a syntax error printed out to the screen.</p><p>\nIn this below example, the syntax error is a common one—mismatched single and double quotes, which is not allowed in Python. You can replicate the below error by opening the REPL (type <code>python</code> in the command line) and entering the line after the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'This string has mismatched quotes. But Python will help us figure out this bug.\")</span>\n  File <span class=\"nb\">\"&lt;stdin&gt;\"</span>, line <span class=\"m\">1</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'This string has mismatched quotes. But Python will help us figure out this bug.\")</span>\n                                                                                           <span class=\"o\">^</span>\n<span class=\"gr\">SyntaxError</span>: <span class=\"n\">EOL while scanning string literal</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Note the caret (<code>^</code>) underneath the mismatched quote, helpfully pointing out where the error lies. Similarly, if this error happened when running a script, Python would tell us the filename and the line number for the line on which the error occurs.</p><p>\n<strong>Traceback errors</strong> - These errors occur during the execution of a Python program when the program finds itself in an untenable state and must stop. Traceback errors are often logical inconsistencies in a program that is valid Python code. A common traceback error is referring to a variable that hasn't been defined, as below.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">not_a_variable</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"gt\">Traceback (most recent call last):</span>\n  File <span class=\"nb\">\"&lt;stdin&gt;\"</span>, line <span class=\"m\">1</span>, in <span class=\"n\">&lt;module&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"gr\">NameError</span>: <span class=\"n\">name 'not_a_variable' is not defined</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Traceback errors try to tell you a little about what happened in the program that caused the problem, including the category of error, such as <code>NameError</code> or <code>TypeError</code>.</p>\n<h2>Debugging</h2>\n<p>Debugging is a fancy word for fixing problems with a program. Here are some common strategies for debugging a program when first learning Python:</p><p>\n- If the error is a syntax error, look at where the caret is pointing.</p><p>\n- If the error is a syntax error, pay attention to grammatical features such as quotes, parentheses, and indentation.</p><p>\n- If the error is a syntax error, consider reading the program, or the offending line, backward. It's surprising, but this often helps to detect the issue.</p><p>\n- If the error is a traceback error, first look at the line where the error occured, then consider the general category of error. What could have gone wrong?</p><p>\n- If the error is a name error (NameError), check your spelling.</p><p>\n- If the error is a traceback error, try copying the last line of the error and pasting it into Google. You'll often find a quick solution this way.</p><p>\n- If you changed the program and expect a different output, but are getting old output, you may not have saved the file. Go back and make sure the file has been correctly saved.</p>",

They look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">books</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s1\">'Gender Trouble'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">'Cruising Utopia'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">'Living a Feminist Life'</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>For now, let's just create a list and print it out. In a text editor, our script will look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">books</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s1\">'Gender Trouble'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">'Cruising Utopia'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">'Living a Feminist Life'</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">books</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Save this to a new file called <code>loop.py</code> and run it with <code>python loop.py</code>. You should see the list printed out in the terminal.</p><p>\nSo far, we've only learned one function: <code>type()</code>. Let's try out another:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">books</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s1\">'Gender Trouble'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">'Cruising Utopia'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">'Living a Feminist Life'</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># print(books)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">list_length</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">book</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">list_length</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The <code>len()</code> function returns the number of items in a list or the number of characters in a string.</p><p>\nNotice that, if you run the code above, you won't see the <code>books</code> list printed out. That's because that line has become a comment. If you put a <code>#</code> (hash or pound) at the beginning of a line, that line will be ignored.</p>\n<h2>List Indexing</h2>\n<p>A useful property of a list is the list index. This allows you to pick out an item from within the list by a number starting from zero:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">books</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">])</span> <span class=\"c1\"># Gender Trouble</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">books</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">])</span> <span class=\"c1\"># Cruising Utopia</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Note that the first item in the list is item [0]. The second item is item [1]. That's because counting in Python, and in almost all programming languages, starts from 0.</p><p>\nYou can print out the last item in a list using negative numbers:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">books</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">])</span> <span class=\"c1\"># Living a Feminist Life</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<!-- Adding some practice with slicing -->\n<h3>Slicing Lists</h3>\n<p>There are many things you can do with list indexing. Let's play around with slicing. Slicing consists of taking a section of a list, using the list index to pick out a range of list items. For example, you could take out the first <em>two</em> items of a list with a slice that begins with <code>0</code> and ends with <code>2</code>. </p><p>\nThe slice syntax consists of square brakets, start point and end point, and a colon to indicate the gap in between. This should print out the first two items of your list. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">books</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Note a couple of things. First, the start point is <em>inclusive</em>, meaning that Python will include the <code>[0]</code> item in your range, and the end point is <em>exclusive</em>, so Python won't print the <code>[2]</code> item. Instead, it will print everything up until that <code>[2]</code> item. </p><p>\nFor ultimate brevity, you can also write this expression as:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">books</span><span class=\"p\">[:</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The empty value before the colon allows Python to assume the range starts at the first list item, at <code>[0]</code>. You can also end the slice with <code>:</code>, if you want the list range to include all subseuquent items until the end of the list. The example below will print everything from the second item to the end of the list. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">books</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">:])</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>With a list that contains three items total, list slicing might not seem very impressive right now. However, this will become a powerful tool once we get to Text Analysis and start to encounter lists that contain hundreds (or thousands!) of items.</p>\n<h2>Loops</h2>\n<p>What if we want to print out each item in the list separately? For that, we'll need something called a loop:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">books</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s1\">'Gender Trouble'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">'Cruising Utopia'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">'Living a Feminist Life'</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># print(books)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">book</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">books</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"My favorite book is \"</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">book</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>What's happening here? This kind of loop is called a \"for\" loop, and tells Python: \"for each item in the list, do something.\" Let's break it down:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nv\">variable</span> <span class=\"nv\">name</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"nv\">in</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nv\">list</span> <span class=\"nv\">name</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span>:\n    <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"k\">do</span> <span class=\"nv\">something</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Indented code like this is known as a \"code block.\" Python will run the <code>&lt;do something&gt;</code> code in the code block once for each item in the list. You can also refer to <code>&lt;variable name&gt;</code> in the <code>&lt;do something&gt;</code> block.</p><p>\nYou can also perform more complicated operations. Let's tackle one in a challenge. But first, a note on naming variables.</p>\n<h2>A Note on Variable Names</h2>\n<p>In this section, we've discussed books in the context of a list. Why do we use the variable name <code>books</code> in this section for our list of book names? Why not just use the variable name <code>x</code>, or perhaps <code>f</code>?</p><p>\nWhile the computer might not care if our list of books is called <code>x</code>, giving variables meaningful names makes a program considerably easier to read than it would be otherwise. Consider this for loop:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s1\">'Gender Trouble'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">'Cruising Utopia'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">'Living a Feminist Life'</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Which is easier to read, this for loop or the one used in the example?</p><p>\nWhen variable names accurately reflect what they represent, and are therefore meaningful, we call them \"semantic.\" Always try to create semantic variable names whenever possible.</p>",

I'm just a little program...\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>When you run this program, Python should ask you for some input with the prompt <code>\"Which book do you want to read today? \"</code> (The space before the second <code>\"</code> makes the prompt look more tidy in the console.) It will then return some advice based on the input. Try running it now.</p>\n<h2>Doing Things to Lists</h2>\n<p>Okay. Let's make our little book application a little more robust. We are going to create a list of books (remember lists?) that we can then manipulate in all sorts of ways.</p><p>\nFirst, create a list with at least three books that are important to your research right now. Shorten the titles if need be. Let's call this list our <code>library</code>. Remember the proper syntax for creating a list includes square brakets with quotations and commas separating the list items.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"go\">library = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Next, let's sort our <code>library</code> in alphabetical order. There's a handy method called <code>sort()</code> for doing just this kind of thing. What's a <em>method</em>, you might ask? Well, <em>methods</em> are very similar to <em>functions</em>, and you'll remember that functions are ways of doing things, like <code>print()</code> and <code>type()</code>. Methods are also ways of doing things, but these things are attached to what we call <em>objects</em> in Python. Objects are part of object-oriented programming, and that's definitely not necessary to learn right now. Suffice it to say that methods are just like functions, that is, they are ways of doing things to your data.</p><p>\nTo sort the list, use the <code>sort()</code> method on your list. It should look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"go\">library = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]</span>\n<span class=\"go\">library.sort()</span>\n<span class=\"go\">print(library)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>What happened here? Let's take it line by line. First, we created a list <code>library</code> with three items attached to it. Then, we applied the <code>sort()</code> method to the library list. Finally, we printed the <code>library</code>, which is now sorted in alphabetical order.</p><p>\nYou'll see that we have a couple of new things happening with symbols. First, the period (<code>.</code>) which we call an <em>operator</em> in Python. The period operator is another part of object-oriented programming, and it basically means that we are applying a task to whatever precedes the period. In this case, we are applying the <code>sort()</code> method to our <code>library</code> list. It's kind of like attaching a function to our <code>library</code>. Second, we have the parenthesis <code>()</code> after <code>sort</code>. When you get more comfortable with programming, you'll see that you can use the parentheses to add what we call <em>arguments</em> that allows us to do more complex things to data. Let's see how an argument works with the <code>append()</code> method.</p><p>\nWhat if we want to add items to the list? We can use the <code>append()</code> method for that. Try:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"go\">library = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]</span>\n<span class=\"go\">library.append(\"La Frontera\")</span>\n<span class=\"go\">print(library)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here, we added <code>\"La Frontera\"</code> as an argument to the <code>append()</code> method, but putting it between the parenthesis. It basically means that we will be appending this specific title to the library list. </p><p>\nWhen you print <code>library</code>, you should see your new book appear at the end of the list. Pretty cool, right? Go ahead and add a couple more books to your list.</p><p>\nWhat if you wanted to take out some of the books? We can use <code>pop()</code> to remove the last item, or \"pop\" it off, from our list. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"go\">library = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\", \"La Frontera\", \"Dawn\"]</span>\n<span class=\"go\">library.pop()</span>\n<span class=\"go\">print(library)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The last item that you added to your list should be missing from the <code>library</code> when you print the list.</p>",

We could add a bunch of new <code>elif</code> statements, like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">...</span>\n<span class=\"k\">elif</span> <span class=\"n\">response</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Sort books\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">library</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">sort</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">library</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">elif</span> <span class=\"n\">response</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"SORT BOOKS\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">library</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">sort</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">library</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"o\">...</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This is a lot of work, and it's a pretty ugly solution. If we wanted to add more cases to our program, we would have to write them in twice every time, and it still wouldn't fix inputs like <code>Sort Books</code>. The best way to improve our program would be to convert the input to lower case before we send it to our <code>if/else</code> block.</p>\n<h2>Googling for answers</h2>\n<p>Even if you're a super rad Python programmer, you're not going to remember every function name or how to do things you might not have touched in awhile. One thing programmers get very good at is googling for answers. In fact, this is arguably the most important skill in modern-day programming. So let's use Google to find out how to convert strings to lower case.</p><p>\nLet's try the search term <a href=\"http://lmgtfy.com/?q=make+string+lowercase+Python\" target=\"_blank\"><code>make string lowercase Python</code></a>:</p><p>\n<img alt=\"make string lower case Python Google search\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/python/google_search.png\"/></p><p>\nWhile Google searches change over time, some of your results likely come from a site called Stack Overflow. This is a questions and answers site for programmers that usually has strong answers to questions about Python.</p><p>\n<img alt=\"Google search results with stack overflow answer on top\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/python/google_result.png\"/></p><p>\nOn <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6797984/how-do-i-lowercase-a-string-in-python\">this Stack Overflow page</a>, take a quick look at the question to make sure it's relevant to your problem. Then scroll down to the answers to find what we're looking for. You may also notice snarky debates -- another \"feature\" of Stack Overflow.</p>\n<h2>Implementing our answer</h2>\n<p>According to this answer, we can make a string lowercase by adding <code>.lower()</code> to the end of it, like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"s2\">\"SORT BOOKS\"</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lower</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"go\">'sort books'</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>OK, that seems to work, even if we don't really know what's going on with that dot. Let's incorporate this transformation into our weather app:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">library</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Orlando\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Confessions of the Fox\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"These Waves of Girls\"</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">response</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">input</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"What do you want to do with your books today? \"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">response</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">response</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lower</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">response</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"sort books\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">library</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">sort</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">library</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">elif</span> <span class=\"n\">response</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"add a book\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">library</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"La Frontera\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">library</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">elif</span> <span class=\"n\">response</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"remove a book\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">library</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">pop</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">library</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">else</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> \n    <span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"I don't know what you want me to do!\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This new script should handle any combination of upper or lowercase characters. The new second line sets the response variable to a new value, <code>response.lower()</code>, which is a lowercase version of the original input.</p><p>\nThere's no shame in googling for answers! Error messages are especially useful to google when you run into them. Keep an eye out for Stack Overflow answers, as they tend to have useful examples. The <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/\">official Python documentation</a> will also frequently come up, but I would recommend avoiding it as a resource until you have more programming experience. It's a great resource, but the way information is presented can be confusing until you get the hang of reading documentation.</p>",

The real point of this section is to learn <code>import</code>, which is where Python really starts to get interesting. Python comes with many libraries (importable collections of code), and you can install many more.

When a function is inside an object, we usually call the function a \"method.\" When data is inside an object, we usually call it an \"attribute.\" The terminology isn't that important, though. What we do need to know is that you can access these \"methods\" and \"attributes\" with a <code>.</code> (a dot or period).</p><p>\nWhen we added lower case to our weather program, we briefly saw a method contained inside all string objects in Python—<code>lower()</code>, which makes the string lower case.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"n\">loud_greeting</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"HELLO!\"</span>\n<span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"n\">loud_greeting</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lower</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"go\">'hello!'</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Many, or most, objects in Python have methods that allow you to use them in different ways.

This challenge uses that function to create a little library app. You will play around with the input button, asking the user what kinds of things they want to do with their library, and writing some code that does those things and prints out the results.</p>\n<p>First, create a new file called <code>library.py</code>. Save it to your current working folder.</p>\n<p>Second, create a list of <code>library</code> books, with at least three books (you can use the same ones as before). </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">library</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;Orlando&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;Confessions of the Fox&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;These Waves of Girls&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Then, add an input statement that will save the user's response to a variable, like <code>response</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">response</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">input</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;What do you want to do with your books today? &quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Now, create a conditional statement that matches the user's response to series of options for doing things to the <code>library</code> list. You can include <code>sort()</code>, <code>append()</code>, and <code>pop()</code>. I'll do the first one, <code>sort()</code>, for you:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">library</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;Orlando&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;Confessions of the Fox&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;These Waves of Girls&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">response</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">input</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;What do you want to do with your books today? &quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">response</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;sort&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">library</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">sort</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">library</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">else</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> \n    <span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;I don&#39;t know what you want me to do!&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>See how the order of statements build on each other toward the final product? First, we create a library of books. Then, we set the user's response about what to do with those books. Then, we create a conditional statement that matches the response to specific tasks. The first condition checks to see if the user wants to \"sort\" the books, then sorts them, then prints the final result.</p>\n<p>After adding a few more conditions, test out your code! You should have a little library app that sorts, adds, and removes books from your list.</p>"

So <code>book_1</code> or <code>b1</code> is acceptable, though you cannot use special characters at any point in the variable name. </p>\n<p>Second, you might also notice that variable syntax requires you to write the variable name first, followed by an equal sign <code>=</code>, and then the value, which can be any data type. You cannot start the variable statement with the data value, because python always recognizes the first thing written as the thing to be assigned.

            "text": "<p>Websites seem like these magical things that appear when we open our web browser (i.e. Chrome, Firefox, Safari). We know that websites are hypertext, meaning that we can click between links, travelling from page to page until we find what we need. What may be less obvious about websites is that, fundamentally <strong>websites are plain text documents</strong>, usually written in HTML or another web-based markup language, such as XML or XHTML.</p><p>\n<em>Fun fact</em>: <strong>Nearly 80% of all websites (whose markup language we know) use HTML.</strong></p><p>\n<a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ml-html/all/all\">(w3techs.com)</a></p>\n<h2>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h2>\n<p>HTML is a markup language used to write web-based documents. It enables us to provide web browsers with information about the <em>content</em> of a document. We can, for example, indicate that some part of our document is a paragraph, image, heading, or link. The browser uses this information when displaying the document for users.</p>\n<h2>Markup language vs. programming Language</h2>\n<p>HTML is a <em>markup</em> language, not a programming language. Programming languages are used to transform data, by creating scripts that organize an output of data based on a particular input of data. A markup language is used to control the presentation of data.</p><p>\nFor a practical example of this difference, we can think about tables. A programming language can help you search through a table, understand the kinds of data the table includes, find particular data points, or transform its content into other kinds of data, such as frequencies. A markup language would instead determine the content, layout, and visual presentation of the table.</p><p>\nFundamentally, then, a script or program is a set of instructions given to the computer. A document in a markup language determines how information is presented to a user.</p><p>\n<strong>NOTE - Markup vs Markdown:</strong> Markdown and HTML are both types of markup languages; Markdown is a play on words. Markup languages help format content.</p>\n<h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>\n<p>CSS is usually used in conjunction with HTML. HTML tells the browser what the different parts of a document <em>are</em>. CSS tells the browser what the parts of the document should <em>look like</em>. It is essentially a set of rules that are applied when rendering an HTML document. Its name—Cascading Style Sheets—refers to the fact that there is an order of precedence in how the browswer applies CSS rules to a document. More specific rules overwrite less specific rules.</p>\n<h2>Where does the internet come in?</h2>\n<p>Together, these languages can be used to write and style a website using a text editor (such as VS Code) directly from your computer. No internet access needed.</p><p>\nHowever, internet access is necessary if you plan on making your website available to the public. At the end of this workshop, we will briefly discuss <a href=\"19-public.md\">how to get your website from your local computer onto the internet</a>.</p>",

This tells the browser how to read the code below it to render the page. If the webpage were written with a different markup language (i.e. XML, XHTML), it would tell you here.</p><p>\nAfter the <code>DOCTYPE</code>, we see the start of the <strong>Root Element</strong>. EVERYTHING—all content—that you want presented on this page and all information about how you want that information to be organized and styled goes in the root element, and it is demarcated by <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>.</p><p>\nThe root element begins by indicating which language the document is written in; and in this basic template, <code>en</code> tells us and the computer that we are writing in English.</p><p>\nWithin the root element of the basic template above, you'll notice the two main sections of all HTML documents: a head section (demarcated by <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>) and a body section (demarcated by <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>).</p><p>\nThe <strong>head section</strong> contains basic information about the file such as the title, keywords, authors, a short description, and so on. This is also where you will link to your CSS stylesheet which describes how you want the page styled—colors, fonts, size of text, and positioning of elements on the page.</p><p>\nThe <strong>body section</strong> contains the content of the page, including paragraphs, images, links, and more, and indicates how this content is to be structured on the page.</p>\n<h2>Activity</h2>\n<p>Create a folder called <code>htmlpractice</code> in your projects folder (<code>~/Desktop/projects/htmlpractice</code>). If you haven't created a projects folder in an earlier session, you can create one now. Inside that folder, create a new text file and save it as <code>index.html</code>.</p><p>\nLet's use the command line to create the new folder and file:</p><p>\n1. Open your terminal.</p><p>\n2. Navigate to your projects folder using this command:</p><p>\n<code>bash\n    cd ~/Desktop/projects</code></p><p>\n3. Create a new folder:</p><p>\n<code>bash\n    mkdir htmlpractice</code></p><p>\n4. Use your VS Code text editor to create a file called <code>index.html</code>: <code>code index.html</code>.</p><p>\n5. Paste the template above (starting with <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>) into the new file.</p><p>\nThe <code>index.html</code> file is your default homepage for the website we are creating. This is an industry standard, because web browsers tend to recognize the <code>index.html</code> page as the opening page to the directory that is your website. See <a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/index-html-page-3466505\">here</a> for more explanation.</p><p>\nOnce you've created your new file, open it with a web browser using your graphical user interface:</p><p>\nOn macOS, click on the Finder in your dock (the apps at the bottom of the screen) and click on Desktop on the left. From there, navigate to <code>projects</code>, then <code>htmlpractice</code>. Alternately, you can click the projects folder icon on your Desktop and find it from there. If you're using a Mac and would prefer to use the command line, you can also type <code>open index.html</code> from within your <code>htmlpractice</code> folder.</p><p>\nOn Windows, click the <code>projects</code> folder icon on your desktop. Navigate to <code>projects</code>, then <code>htmlpractice</code>. Double click the <code>index.html</code> file. If it does not open in a browser, right click the <code>index.html</code> icon and select \"Open with...\" from the menu. Select Firefox or Google Chrome from the app list that appears.</p>\n<h3>What happens?</h3>\n<p>When you open the empty template, you'll see only a blank web page. Open your secondary menu (right click on Windows, hold control and click with macOS) and view the page source. How can you explain what happens when you open these text files?</p>\n<h2>What should happen when I open each of my two new files?</h2>\n<p>When you \"View Page Source,\" you should see the code for the basic template.</p><p>\nNo content renders on the page, because there is no content in the template at this time.</p>",

            "text": "<p>Tags and elements are the structuring components of html webpages.</p><p>\n<strong>Elements</strong> identify the different parts of a page, such as paragraphs, headings, titles, body text, images and more. Elements are demarcated by tags which enclose the content of an element (ex. <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> are tags that denote the head element of your page).</p><p>\n<strong>Tags</strong> demarcate elements in one of two ways. As with the paragraph element below, an element can have an opening and a closing tag, with the content in between.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">p</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>This is a paragraph.<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">p</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">p</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    This is also a paragraph.\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">p</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Elements which have an opening and closing tag can have other elements inside them. Inside the paragraph element below is a strong element, which emphasizes the included text by making it bold.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">p</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    When I came home from school, I saw he had <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">strong</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>stolen<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">strong</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span> my chocolate pudding.\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">p</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Other elements have self-closing tags as with the image element below. These tags are also called <strong>void tags</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">img</span> <span class=\"na\">src</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"image.jpeg\"</span> <span class=\"p\">/&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>These elements don't require a separate closing tag. Closing tags aren't needed because you wouldn't add content inside these elements. For example, it doesn't make sense to add any additional content inside an image.</p><p>\nBelow is HTML that adds alternative text to an image—or text that describes the image. This information added is an attribute—or something that modifies the default functionality of an element.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">img</span> <span class=\"na\">alt</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"This is an image\"</span> <span class=\"na\">src</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"image.jpeg\"</span> <span class=\"p\">/&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Adding alternative text to an image, as was done in this example, is vitally important. That information makes the image more accessible to those viewing your site. For instance, users with poor vision who may not be able to see your image will still understand what it is and why it's there if you provide alternative text describing it.</p><p>\nIf you look back at the basic template in your <code>index.html</code> file, you'll see that the main sections of your file have opening and closing tags. Each of these main elements will eventually hold many other elements, many of which will be the content of our website.</p>",

They provide information about the structure of a web page, showing how its parts work together. Those who make use of assistive technologies such as screen readers rely on this semantic information to navigate the page. Thus, it's important to use elements such as headers only when the information being marked calls for it. Making text large and/or bold for visual effect should be done using CSS. The Mozilla Developer Network has some good <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#Semantics_in_HTML\">introductory information on semantic HTML</a>.</p>\n<h2>Activity</h2>\n<p>Using your text editor, add the following to your <code>index.html</code>:</p><p>\n- Title</p><p>\n- Heading</p><p>\n- Paragraph</p><p>\nThen, re-save the file.

            "text": "<p>Links are the foundation of the World Wide Web, and thus are an important component of most websites. Hyperlinking text enables users to move between the different webpages on your site (sometimes in the form of a menu or navigation bar), or connect to other resources or information on other websites.</p><p>\nThe <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, or <strong>anchor tag</strong>, creates a link to another document. You can use the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag to link to other documents or webpages you created for the same site or to documents located elsewhere on the web. You can also use it to link to a particular location on a page—we'll see an example of this in the section on classes and ids.</p>\n<h2>Option One: Relative Links</h2>\n<p>Relative links take the current page as an origin point and search for other files within the same folder or directory. This method is useful for creating links to pages within your own site.</p><p>\nThe following appears as a link to the <code>about.html</code> page in the same folder as <code>index.html</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">a</span> <span class=\"na\">href</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"about.html\"</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>About<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">a</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>On your webpage it will appear as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"#\">About</a></p><p>\nThis link is asking the browser to look for a file titled <code>about.html</code> in the same folder. If a file named <code>about.html</code> is not in the same folder, clicking the link will result in a <code>404</code> (\"Page Not Found\") error.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Option Two: Absolute Links</h2>\n<p>An absolute link includes information that allows the browser to find resources on other websites. This information includes the site domain—such as <code>google.com</code>—and often the protocol—such as <code>http</code> or <code>https</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">a</span> <span class=\"na\">href</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"http://www.google.com\"</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>Google<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">a</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>On your webpage it will appear as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.google.com\">Google</a></p><p>\nThis pathway is directing your browser to look online for this text document at the URL address provided.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>More on links</h2>\n<p>Each example above includes an <code>href</code> tag. The <code>href</code> tag, short for hypertext reference, is an example of an <strong>attribute</strong>. Attributes offer secondary information about an element.</p><p>\nThe <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, or anchor tag, creates a link. The text within the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code> tags, the anchor text, is what a visitor to the site will see and can click on. The <code>href=</code> attribute tells the browser where the user should be directed when they click the link.</p><p>\nThere is another technical difference between the two options above.</p>\n<h2>Relative vs. Absolute Links: When to use which</h2>\n<p>Use relative links when referring to pages on your own site. The main advantage of using relative links to pages on your site is that your site will not break if it is moved to a different folder or environment.</p>\n<h2>Activity</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new text file called <code>about.html</code> in your <code>htmlpractice</code> folder. Copy over the HTML from your <code>index.html</code> file, but change the text in the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element to \"About.\"</li>\n<li>In your <code>index.html</code> file, add a relative link leading to your About page.</li>\n<li>Also add a relative link from your <code>About page</code> to your <code>index.html</code> page. In this link, call your <code>index.html</code> page <code>Home</code> (Reminder: <code>index.html</code> is the default homepage)</li>\n<li>Lastly, include an absolute link to a page of your choosing. Remember that an absolute link includes the protocol (for example, <code>http:</code>) and also a domain (for example, <code>cuny.edu</code>), such as <code>http://cuny.edu/about</code>.</li>\n<li>Re-save your text files and reopen or refresh them in your browser.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Check if it worked</h2>\n<p>When your pages are updated, you should be able to navigate from your Home page to your About page, and vice versa. You should also be able to navigate to the external web page.</p>",

            "text": "<p>Images are another important component of websites. Sometimes these just help bring your website to life, but other times they can help communicate information to users.</p><p>\nImages are created with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. Similar to the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> requires an attribute, in this case <code>src</code>. The <code>src</code> attribute stands for \"source\" and communicates secondary information to your browser that identifies and locates the image. Unlike many other tags, the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag does not need to be closed, making it an example of a void tag.</p><p>\nThe following element pulls in an image located in the same folder as the <code>.html</code> file:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">img</span> <span class=\"na\">src</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"scream.jpeg\"</span> <span class=\"p\">/&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The same rules apply here as with the <code>href</code> attribute: if the image is not located in the same folder as the document you are writing in, the browser won't find it. If the browser cannot find an image resource, you will see a broken image icon, such as this one from Chrome:</p><p>\n<img alt=\"Chrome broken image icon\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/html-css/broken.png\"/></p><p>\nNote: Some sites use a lot of images. When this is the case, it can be helpful to keep images in a separate folder within your site's structure. To enable the browser to find an image in that case, just add the directory in front of the file name. For example, if you have a folder named images in the same folder as your index.html file, and scream.jpeg is in that folder, you'd change the void tag above to <code>&lt;img src=\"/images/scream.jpeg\" /&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h2>Making images accessible</h2>\n<p>As briefly noted earlier, alternative text, or alt text, is descriptive \"text associated with an image that serves the same purpose and conveys the same essential information as the image\" (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Accessibility/Alternative_text_for_images\">Wikipedia Manual of Style/Accessibility/Alternative Text for Images</a> for more), and is important for ensuring content conveyed by images is accessible to all.</p><p>\nTo add alternative text to an image, you add an additional attribute, <code>alt</code> followed by your descriptive text. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">img</span> <span class=\"na\">src</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"filename.png\"</span> <span class=\"na\">alt</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"Text in these quotes describes the image\"</span> <span class=\"p\">/&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>For more information, see what the <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/files/SSA_Alternative_Text_Guide.pdf\">Social Security Administration</a> has to say.</p>\n<h2>What images can I use on my site?</h2>\n<p>If you're planning to use images that you did not take or make yourself, you'll need to use \"public domain\" or \"open license\" images.</p><p>\nThis <a href=\"https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/blog/help/following-copyright-guidelines-for-images/\">guide by the OpenLab at City Tech</a> includes more information on licensure and a list of places where you can find reuseable images.</p>\n<h2>Activity</h2>\n<p>Download and save an image from the web, or move an image from your computer into the same folder as your <code>index.html</code> file.</p><p>\nTip: Give the file a simple name. Also, the name <strong>cannot</strong> have spaces. A good practice is to use either dashes or underscores where there would otherwise be spaces. For example: <code>this-is-an-image.jpg</code> or <code>this_is_an_image.jpg</code>.</p><p>\nUsing the code above as a reference, add that image into your <code>index.html</code> file, re-save the file, and re-open or refresh the page in your browser. Your image should now appear on the page.</p>",

Self-closing tags are called void tags, and are generally self-closing because you wouldn't need or want to add another element within a tag.

While HTML is not case sensitive, it makes scanning the code easier, and makes it look more consistent.</p><p>\n- Your code should be nested.

This page should include the following:</p><p>\n- Doctype</p><p>\n- Root element</p><p>\n- Head and a body</p><p>\n- Title for the page</p><p>\n- One heading</p><p>\n- One paragraph</p><p>\n- One image</p><p>\n- A menu or navigation bar that links to your Home and About pages</p><p>\nThink about the order of your content as you assemble the body of your page.</p><p>\nDon't worry about getting the content just right, as much as using this exercise to review the structure of a webpage, and practice creating a webpage.</p>\n<h2>Additional Tags</h2>\n<p>Here are two additional tags that might come in handy in assembling your page:</p><p>\nTo make a list, you open and close it with the <code>ul</code> tags, and each item is an enclosed <code>li</code> tag:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">ul</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">li</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span> item 1 <span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">li</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">li</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span> item 2 <span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">li</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">li</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span> item 3 <span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">li</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">ul</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The HTML above will produce an unordered (bulleted) list. To create an ordered (numbered) list instead, just substitute <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/ol&gt;</code> for <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code>.</p><p>\n(This may come in handy when making your menu or navigation bar.)</p><p>\nTo make a line break or give space between different elements:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">br</span> <span class=\"p\">/&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Further challenge</h2>\n<p>Finished early?

CSS can be integrated into your HTML in three ways: inline, internal, and external.</p>\n<h2>Option one: inline</h2>\n<p>Inline styling adds CSS directly into the HTML of a page to adjust the style of particular parts of a page.</p><p>\nFor example, if you want the text of your first paragraph to be red, but the text of your second paragraph to be blue:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"cp\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">html</span> <span class=\"na\">lang</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"en\"</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">head</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">title</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>About<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">title</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">head</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">body</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">p</span> <span class=\"na\">style</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"color: red\"</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n            Content of paragraph\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">p</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">p</span> <span class=\"na\">style</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"color: blue\"</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n            Content of paragraph\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">p</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">body</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">html</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Option two: internal</h2>\n<p>Internal styling also adds CSS directly into the HTML, but keeps it separate from the content code of the page by adding it into the head using the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag. When using internal styling you are providing styling rules for the entire page. For example, if you want all headings to be blue:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"cp\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">html</span> <span class=\"na\">lang</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"en\"</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">head</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">title</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>About<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">title</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">style</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">h1</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n              <span class=\"k\">color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">blue</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n            <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">style</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">head</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">body</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">h1</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n            Heading One\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">h1</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">p</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n            Content of paragraph\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">p</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">h1</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n            Heading Two\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">h1</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">p</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n            Content of paragraph\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">p</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">body</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">html</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Option three: external (recommended)</h2>\n<p>External styling creates a completely separate document for your CSS that will be linked to your HTML in the head section of your HTML document using the code below. This separate document is called a <strong>stylesheet</strong> and should be named <code>style.css</code>. This document must be stored in the same folder as the HTML document it is linked to.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"cp\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">html</span> <span class=\"na\">lang</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"en\"</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">head</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">title</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>CSS Example<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">title</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">link</span> <span class=\"na\">rel</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"stylesheet\"</span> <span class=\"na\">href</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"style.css\"</span> <span class=\"p\">/&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">head</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">body</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n        ...\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">body</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">html</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Best practices</h2>\n<p>It's best practice to use Option 3, external styling, for a number of reasons:</p><p>\n1. It helps us remember what each language focuses on: HTML is for <em>content</em>, CSS is for <em>styling</em>. (This is sometimes referred to as <a href=\"https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/\">\"separation of concerns\"</a>)</p><p>\n2. It helps us maintain consistency across the various pages of our site; multiple HTML files can link to the same CSS file.</p><p>\n3. Because multiple HTML files can link to the same CSS file, it's not necessary to write the same CSS code multiple times. Once suffices.</p><p>\nOption 3, external styling, is preferred by most web developers because it's more manageable and because it lends itself to greater consistency across the entire site.</p>",

            "text": "<p>Some of you may be wondering whether it matters what order you add the rule sets to your <code>style.css</code> document. The answer is no. CSS has an automatic filtering function where <strong>the most specific rule in CSS always takes precedence.</strong></p><p>\nSo if your stylesheet contained the following rule sets:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nt\">p</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">green</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">p</span> <span class=\"nt\">strong</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">red</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>...then the text of your paragraph would be green, but where the strong tag is found in the paragraph, the text would be bold and red. In other words, the more specific styling for the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> text in your paragraph will override the less specific styling of the paragraph in general. This would occur <strong>regardless of the order these rule sets appear in the stylesheet.</strong></p><p>\nThis rule also applies to how you integrate CSS into your HTML to style your content. For example, if you link to an external stylesheet, and you add inline or internal CSS into your HTML, the inline or internal CSS will override the rules set in the external stylesheet. Similarly, the inline CSS will override the internal CSS.</p>",

            "text": "<p>Classes and IDs enable more fine-grained styling by allowing you to define your own selectors. The difference between classes and IDs is that IDs are unique, used to identify one specific element or part of an element, whereas classes are used to identify multiple instances of the same type of element.</p><p>\nBasically, if you're styling a part of your page that is unique, such as the navbar or footer, use an ID. If you're styling something that recurs in different places, like an info box or form field, use a class.</p><p>\nIncorporating classes and IDs into the styling of your document includes two steps:</p><p>\n1.

            "text": "<p>Through this workshop, you have learned the basics of two of the most commonly-used languages for building on the web: HTML and CSS.</p><p>\nHTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, organizes content on your page using <a href=\"04-elements.md\">elements denoted by tags (<code>&lt; &gt;</code>)</a>. When rendered by your browser, these tags tell your browser that certain content is paragraph text, while other content is heading or title text, and so on. You can also use <a href=\"07-images.md\">image (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>)</a> and <a href=\"06-links.md\">link or anchor (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>)</a> tags to tell the browser to render an image on the page, or take the visitor to another page on your or another website. We also discussed some important <a href=\"08-conventions.md\">conventions</a> to consider when creating HTML documents, such as nesting.</p><p>\nCSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, allows for further styling of your website through the application of a series of <a href=\"12-rules.md\">rule sets</a> that are applied to different aspects/elements of your site. In order for CSS to render on a webpage, it must be <a href=\"11-integration.md\">integrated with your html</a>, which can happen in three ways: inline, internal, and external. CSS rules can be of varying specificity, and in particular, through creating <a href=\"14-classes.md\">classes and ids</a>. We also discussed how the ordering of rule sets doesn't matter, because an important function of CSS is the way it filters and applies rules in accordance with the specificity of the rule.</p><p>\nThrough understanding these languages in combination with one another, you can also reframe your understanding of the web—not as <em>poof! magic!</em>, but as a series of intentionally styled, hyperlinked text documents, with each website representing a folder of documents.</p><p>\nWhile this is a good starting point, one important question remains: how can I get these text documents on the Internet so they can be accessed, and interacted with, and linked to by others?</p>",

            "text": "<p>Great job! Now you have an amazing website, but it's stuck on your computer where no one else can find it or view it. How do you get your website onto the Internet so it can be shared?</p><p>\nTo get your site on the internet, you'll need <strong>hosting</strong> — that is, a remote computer that will stay on day in and day out to serve the website to visitors. In theory, you could host your website on your own computer, but in practice, it usually makes sense to purchase hosting from a hosting company or use a free service.</p><p>\nYou'll also need a way of getting your website to your host. That's where FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, comes in.</p>\n<h2>FTP</h2>\n<p>FTP is a protocol used to share files from your computer (<em>a client</em>) to another computer called a server, and back again over the Internet. This is something we do ALL THE TIME, but we refer to it as \"uploading\" and \"downloading.\"</p><p>\nNote: Though FTP stands for file transfer protocol, you are not really transfering or moving your files from your computer; instead they are <em>copied</em> to the server. Fear not!</p><p>\nIn order to transfer your website files (also called your website's directory) to a server you will need:</p><p>\n1. Access to the Internet.</p><p>\n2. An FTP Client.</p><p>\n3. A server that is connected to the Internet where you can send your files.</p><p>\nAssuming you all can manage accessing the internet on your own, let's focus on the latter two.</p>\n<h3>FTP client</h3>\n<p>An <strong>FTP client</strong> is software designed specifically for the purpose of sharing files between computers. There are widely-used, freely-available GUI applications (i.e., applications that use a graphic user interface, or the point-and-click, user-friendly software interfaces you are used to) that you can download for use, including <a href=\"https://filezilla-project.org/\">Filezilla</a> and <a href=\"https://cyberduck.io/\">Cyberduck</a>. You can also run an FTP client program through the command line on most computers, though the process varies by operating system.</p>\n<h3>Other Resources about FTP</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2010/02/ftp_for_beginners/\">FTP for Beginners, <em>Wired</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/free-ftp-clients-windows/\">The Three Best FTP Clients for Windows</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/how-to/software/operating-systems/how-to-use-ftp-through-the-command-line-in-mac-os-x-1305664\">How To Use FTP Through the Command Line in Mac OS X</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://beebom.com/how-to-use-mac-terminal-ftp-sftp-client/\">How to Use the Mac Terminal as an FTP or SFTP Client</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Web hosting</h2>\n<p>You also need a server to transfer your files to, where they can be stored and shared on the Internet. This is what we call <strong>web hosting</strong> and there are multiple options here as well. The GCDI (CUNY Graduate Center Digital Initiatives) website contains a list of <a href=\"https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/digital-resource-guide/#cloud\">low-cost cloud hosting services for students</a>. As long as your site is just plain HTML and CSS, it's also possible to host your website for free on services such as <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>\n<h3>Web hosting services</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-web-hosting-services/\">The Best Web Hosting Services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-7-easy-and-free-web-hosting-services/\">Top 7 Easy and Free Web Hosting Services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/free-web-hosting-is-bad/\">10 Ways That Free Web Hosting Is Bad for Your First Website</a></li>\n</ul>",

We will share a conceptual overview of Git and GitHub, explore fundamental concepts such as committing and pushing, and explore practical applications of GitHub for writing and coding. This session will show how to use Git and GitHub for a variety of digital undertakings, including collaborating with others, finding code for use in your projects, and sharing your work publicly. This session covers initializing Git repositories, committing changes, pushing to GitHub, and cloning repositories to your local machine.",

            "text": "<h2>What is Git?</h2>\n<p><strong>Git</strong> is software used for version control—that is, tracking the state of files and changes you make to them over time. Git can be enabled in a folder, and then used to save the state of the contents in that folder at different points in the future, as designated by you. In the language of Git, a folder is called a <em>repository</em>. In the context of this workshop, it refers to a folder that is being tracked by Git. Using Git, you can view a log of the changes you've made to the files in a repository and compare changes over time. You can also revert back to previous versions, and create branches of a project to explore different futures. Git is also useful for collaboration, as a repository can be shared across computers, and its contents can be asynchonously developed and eventually merged with the main project. </p>\n<h2>What is GitHub?</h2>\n<p><strong>GitHub</strong> is a online platform for hosting Git repositories. It functions for some, predominantly programmers, as a social network for sharing and collaborating on code-based projects. Users can share their own projects, as well as search for others, which they can then often work on and contribute to. Digital Humanists, librarians, and other academics are also finding ways Git and GitHub are useful in writing projects and teaching. GitHub also serves as a web-hosting platform, allowing users to create websites from their repositories.</p>\n<h2>What is Markdown?</h2>\n<p>Markdown is a markup language for formatting text. Like HTML, you add markers to plain text to style and organize the text of a document.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>In HTML: \n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;h1&gt;</span> Heading 1 <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>\nIn Markdown:\n# Heading 1\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Whereas you use HTML and CSS with WordPress, you use Markdown with GitHub. Markdown has fewer options for marking text than HTML. It was designed to be human-readable, meaning easy to write and edit. </p><p>\nThis file you are reading is written in markdown—<a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/master/sections/concept.md\">here</a> is what it looks like in its raw, unrendered form.</p><p>\nCompare that with this - the source code for the GitHub page, written in HTML: view-source:https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git</p><p>\nMarkdown is also arguably more sustainable and accessible than formats like <code>.docx</code> because of its simplicity and related ability to be read across multiple platforms. Use of Markdown is also supported by document-conversion tools like <a href=\"https://pandoc.org/\">Pandoc</a> that can change a markdown file to an epub with one command entered into your terminal.</p>\n<h2>Highlighting Distinctions</h2>\n<p>As we move forward its important to make sure we're firm on the distinctions between the three different tools outlined above. </p><p>\n<strong>Git</strong> is a software that you use on your laptop, or your local computer/machine. The repository with your project's files is stored on your hard drive. You also edit the text files on your local machine using a plain text editor, which is another software on your local machine like VS Code. </p><p>\n<strong>GitHub</strong> is a cloud-based platform that you access through your internet browser. Even though you physically are still in the same place, working on your laptop, you are no longer working on your local machine, you are on the Internet. This is a fundamentally different location than when you're working with your Git repository and editing and creating files in your plain text editor. With GitHub, you are uploading your repository - as described above - from your local machine to this platform on the Internet to be shared more broadly. You can also create private repositories if you want to use GitHub to backup a project.</p><p>\n<strong>Markdown</strong> is the language used to format the plain text files in your Git-enabled repository. GitHub reads this language so that the markups made to the file are rendered when you view your file on the platform (i.e. #headers appears as headers, links are inserted).</p>",

They used GitHub for a diverse range of activities, such as:</p><p>\n- Developing software</p><p>\n- Sharing data sets</p><p>\n- Creating websites</p><p>\n- Writing articles and books</p><p>\n- Collating online resources</p><p>\n- Keeping research notes</p><p>\n- Hosting syllabi and course materials</p>\n<h2>Why Use GitHub?</h2>\n<p>Participants in the study said they found GitHub useful in their Digital Humanities work for several reasons. In particular, it facilitated: </p><p>\n- Sharing and backing up files on multiple computers</p><p>\n- Monitoring changes effectively</p><p>\n- Recovering from bugs or errors by going back in time before the error arose</p><p>\n- Using different branches for experiments and new directions</p><p>\n- Sharing and managing files with others—seeing who added what content and when</p>\n<h2>How We Use GitHub:</h2>\n<h3>Sharing and Attribution</h3>\n<p>As you can see across these sessions, we use GitHub to host workshop curricula. Hosting sessions on GitHub allows you (and anyone else interested in these topics!) to follow our repositories, and create your own version of the workshop based on our materials. This fosters open scholarship and knowledge sharing. It also facilitates attribution and citation by clearly tracking which content was created by whom, when it was added, and which projects or materials are derived from others.</p>\n<h4>Case One: This Session</h4>\n<p>If you look just under the workshop title, <code>DHRI-Curriculum/git</code> at the top of this page, you can see it is <code>forked from pswee001/Git_DRI_Jan_2018</code>. That line shows that this particular repository is building on (<em>\"forked from\"</em>) the curriculum for a session I presented at our January 2018 Institute. If you then look at that repository, you will see that it is in turn forked from previous sessions that were developed by other GC Digital Fellows for workshops in past years. </p><p>\n<strong>Forking</strong> is a proper function of the GitHub platform. It supports collaboration by allowing you to copy someone else's repository to your own account on GitHub while maintaining a trail of attribution and derivation. This function is described in further detail in the final lesson of this workshop.</p>\n<h3>Collaborative Writing</h3>\n<p>Git is also used to track changes (<em>version control</em> in Git parlance) in writing projects, especially when there are multiple authors working asynchronously. It can be an alternative to using track changes in Microsoft Word, or comments and edits in a Google Doc.</p>\n<h4>Case Two: Coauthored Publications</h4>\n<p>Git and GitHub - together or independently - support multi-author publishing. Like we have done with the DHRI curriculum, you can have a shared project folder that multiple people are working from asynchronously, even on the same parts if they wanted, and then those different offshoots can be carefully folded back into the master project. This entails the process of creating <em>branches</em> and <em>merging</em>.</p><p>\nGit and GitHub also help with attribution by tracking individual contributions throughout. Additional branches could be created by a singular author as well, allowing the writer to explore different ways forward. The version control feature also allows authors to easily return to and compare older drafts or retrieve sections previoulsy discarded. </p><p>\n<strong>Branches</strong> and <strong>merging</strong> are important functionalities when using Git to collaborate, but they are also advanced and thus beyond the scope of this workshop. See the <em>Resources</em> section at the end of the workshop for more information.</p>\n<h3>Versions Across Time</h3>\n<p>How did you initially come by the syllabus you use for your class, and did you develop it over time? Many professors borrow and adapt from each other, and most of us probably update our syllabi each semester, even if only a little bit.</p><p>\nPut your hand up if you have a folder somewhere that looks something like this. Or even multiple folders. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">|</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">--Documents</span>\n   <span class=\"o\">|</span>\n   <span class=\"c1\">--syllabus.doc</span>\n   <span class=\"c1\">--syllabus2.doc </span>\n   <span class=\"c1\">--syllabusnew.doc </span>\n   <span class=\"c1\">--syllabusRevised.doc </span>\n   <span class=\"c1\">--syllabusFINAL.doc </span>\n   <span class=\"c1\">--syllabus?.doc </span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Ok, hands down. </p><p>\n<strong>Consider the following questions as well:</strong></p><p>\n- Can you remember who you initially got this syllabus from?</p><p>\n- Do you know if there were other contributors along with or before them? </p><p>\n- Do you acknowledge prior contributors somewhere on your syllabus? </p><p>\n- Can you or others see what changes have been made to the syllabus over time? </p>\n<h4>Case Three: Syllabi</h4>\n<p>Increasingly we see that faculty are sharing their syllabi on GitHub. Some are even using GitPages that apply a user-friendly interface to their repository to make it easier to access and navigate for their students. This is because Git and GitHub make it easy to make contributors and changes to documents over time visible. </p><p>\nUsing Git and GitHub, you could fork that syllabi to your account, and download - or <em>clone</em> as Git calls it - it to your local machine to edit. After making changes to the files and and reuploading them or <em>pushing</em> them to the repo (short for repository) on GitHub, someone else could compare the changes you made and see who the original or additional contributors were. They could also decide to continue the chain by copying or forking your version, or decide to return to the original repo and fork that version. Both Git and GitHub help with attribution here; tracking who changes and adds what is a key feature of both tools.</p><p>\nEven if you were only working with your own self-created syllabus, like we'll do later in this workshop, Git and GitHub can be useful for tracking your changes without the hassle of multiple files. From one file, you can use Git to compare your current version with older versions; you can also compare and share these different versions on GitHub.</p><p>\n<strong>Cloning</strong> and <strong>pushing</strong> are proper functionalities of GitHub that describe how you communicate and share files between your local machine and the Internet. These are covered more in-depth in a later lesson in this workshop.</p>",

It will be useful if you've taken <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/command-line\">the Command Line Workshop</a> before continuing. This section reviews some of the basic commands that will also be used in this workshop.</p><p>\nIn addition to the command line, you'll be using your text editor and your browser. Before continuing, its important that we clearly distinguish between these three different spaces or environments:</p><p>\n- Your plain text editor where you'll be writing your syllabus in Markdown is on your local machine. </p><p>\n- That syllabus is intiailly saved in a git-enabled repository on your local machine.</p><p>\n- Your browser is where you'll be uploading your repository to GitHub.</p><p>\n- Your terminal is where you'll be communicating with GitHub to send the repository and project files back and forth between the web and your hard drive. </p><p>\nBecause you'll be moving between these three spaces throughout the workshop, you may want to use (command + tab) or (ctrl + tab) to move quickly between the three windows on your desktop.</p>\n<h2>Accessing the Terminal</h2>\n<h3>Mac OS</h3>\n<p>Press the space bar and the command key at the same time and type <code>terminal</code>. Press <code>Enter</code>.</p>\n<h3>Windows</h3>\n<p>Press the Windows button on your keyboard. When the search menu pops up, type <code>git bash</code> and press <code>Enter</code>.</p>\n<h2>Practice Navigating the Command Line</h2>\n<p>In this session, we will be making a syllabus and using Git to keep track of our revisions. Let's create a Git project folder</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">cd</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">directory</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> \n</code></pre></div>\n<p>will let you navigate inside a directory of your choosing.</p><p>\nType </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">cd</span> <span class=\"n\">Desktop</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>and hit <code>Enter</code>. This will change your current working directory from <code>/Users/&lt;your-name&gt;</code> to <code>/Users/&lt;your-name&gt;/Desktop</code>.</p><p>\nTo check your current directory, type</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">pwd</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Try this now to make sure you're in your Desktop directory.</p><p>\nNow, use </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">cd</span> <span class=\"p\">..</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>to go up one directory. In this case, this will take you back to your home directory.</p><p>\nPractice going back and forth between your Desktop and your home directory.</p><p>\nWhen finished, go to your Desktop folder and check that you're there with <code>pwd</code>.</p>\n<h2>Making a Git Project Folder</h2>\n<p>If you've worked through the command line session, you should see a <code>projects</code> folder on your desktop. Navigate into it with</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">cd</span> <span class=\"n\">projects</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you don't have a projects folder on your desktop, create one with</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">mkdir</span> <span class=\"n\">projects</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>From <code>Desktop</code>, navigate into your <code>projects</code> folder. Then create a <code>git-practice</code> folder with the below command:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">mkdir</span> <span class=\"n\">git</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">practice</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Enter the new <code>git</code> folder with</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">cd</span> <span class=\"n\">git</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">practice</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>At this point, when you type <code>pwd</code>, your folder structure should look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">home</span><span class=\"o\">/&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">username</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;/</span><span class=\"n\">Desktop</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">projects</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">git</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">practice</span>\n</code></pre></div>",

Through this section, you'll be checking your installation and configuring Git with your own name and information.</p>\n<h2>Check Your Install</h2>\n<p>Let's make sure Git has been successfully installed. In your terminal, type</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">git</span> <span class=\"c1\">--version</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you see a version number, you're all set.

This information is useful because it connects identifying information with the changes you make in your repository. </p><p>\nType the following into your command line, filling in the sections—below labeled \"John Doe\"—for your name and email (use quotations where you see them).

            "text": "<p>The next step is to <strong>initialize</strong> the project folder that we want Git to track. When we initialize a folder, we are telling Git to pay attention to it. This only needs to happen once because what is actually happening through this process is Git is adding a hidden subfolder within your folder that houses the internal data structure required for version control. </p><p>\nFirst, use <code>cd</code>, navigate to the <code>git-practice</code> folder inside <code>projects</code>. From your home directory, type:</p><p>\n    cd Desktop/projects/git-practice</p><p>\nNext we're going to <strong>initialize</strong> our repository using the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">git</span> <span class=\"n\">init</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>You should see output like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">Initialized</span> <span class=\"n\">empty</span> <span class=\"n\">Git</span> <span class=\"n\">repository</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span> <span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">home</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">patrick</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">projects</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">git</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">git</span><span class=\"o\">/</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now Git is tracking our directory. Importantly, it has not done any versioning yet. There is no history of changes as of yet: 1) because there are no files and we haven't made any changes, 2) becuase we have to tell Git when to take a snapshot, which we go through in the next section. For now, Git knows this folder exists and is prepared to take a snapshot of the files when you tell it to.</p><p>\nBefore version control is useful, we'll have to create a text file for Git to track. For this session, the file we will track will be a course syllabus—we'll create that next.</p>\n<h3>Creating a Syllabus in Markdown</h3>\n<p>To create a plain text file, we're going to switch to our text editor, VS Code, to create and edit a file named <code>syllabus.md</code> and save it to our 'git-practice' folder. If you have not installed VS Code, review <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/vscode.md\">the installation instructions here</a>.</p><p>\nIn terminal, check to make sure you are in your <code>git-practice</code> folder. (HINT: use 'pwd' to see what directory you are currently in) Next, type:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">code</span> <span class=\"n\">syllabus</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">md</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>to open a <code>syllabus.md</code> file in VS Code. You should see a window appear that looks similar to this:</p><p>\n<img alt=\"Image of what VS Code looks like when opening the syllabus.md file\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/git/vscode1.png\"/></p><p>\nIf VS Code does not open when you use the <code>code</code> command in your terminal, open it using the Start Menu on Windows or Spotlight Search on Mac OS as you would any other software. Then click <code>File &gt; Open File</code> and use the dialog to navigate to the <code>/Users/&lt;your-name&gt;/Desktop/projects/git</code> folder and create a <code>syllabus.md</code> file there.</p><p>\nWe'll be typing our markdown into this file in the VS Code window. At any time, you can save your file by hitting <code>Control-s</code> on Windows or <code>⌘-s</code> on Mac OS. Alternatively, you can click the <code>File</code> menu on the top right, then select <code>Save</code> from the dropdown menu.</p><p>\nSaving frequently is advised. When we get to the version contol functionality of Git, only changes that are saved will be preserved when a version is created. </p>\n<h2>Using Markdown</h2>\n<p>We'll be using markdown to write a syllabus, and then using Git to track any changes we make to it. Markdown allows us to format textual features like headings, emphasis, links, and lists in a plain text file using a streamlined set of notations that humans can interpret without much training. Markdown files usually have a <code>.md</code> extension.</p><p>\nIn markdown, we insert headings with a single hash mark like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">#</span> <span class=\"n\">My</span> <span class=\"n\">Syllabus</span> <span class=\"n\">Heading</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>A sub-heading (H2) heading uses two hash marks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">##</span> <span class=\"n\">Readings</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>To provide emphasis, place asterisks around some text:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">This</span> <span class=\"nb\">text</span> <span class=\"n\">will</span> <span class=\"n\">appear</span> <span class=\"n\">italicized</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"o\">*</span>\n<span class=\"o\">**</span><span class=\"n\">This</span> <span class=\"nb\">text</span> <span class=\"n\">will</span> <span class=\"n\">appear</span> <span class=\"n\">bold</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"o\">**</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>For emphasis, you need to mark where it should start and where it should end, so you need astrisks at the beginning and end of whatever text is being emphasized.</p><p>\nTo create a bulleted list, put a hyphen at the beginning of each list item:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"n\">Reading</span> <span class=\"n\">one</span>\n<span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"n\">Reading</span> <span class=\"n\">two</span>\n<span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"n\">Reading</span> <span class=\"n\">three</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>To create a link, put the anchor text (the text you will see) in square brackets and the URL in parentheses. Don't put a space between them:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">I</span> <span class=\"n\">teach</span> <span class=\"k\">at</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">The</span> <span class=\"n\">Graduate</span> <span class=\"n\">Center</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">CUNY</span><span class=\"p\">](</span><span class=\"n\">https</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"o\">//</span><span class=\"n\">www</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">gc</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">cuny</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">edu</span><span class=\"p\">).</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Paragraphs of text are denoted by putting a blank line between them:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nv\">This</span> <span class=\"nv\">is</span> <span class=\"nv\">a</span> <span class=\"nv\">paragraph</span> <span class=\"nv\">in</span> <span class=\"nv\">markdown</span>. <span class=\"nv\">It</span><span class=\"s1\">'</span><span class=\"s\">s separated from the paragraph below with a blank line.

Now that we have a file to track—our markdown syllabus—let's use Git to save the current state of the repository as it exists now.</p>\n<h2>A Metaphor for Adding and Committing</h2>\n<p>In Git, a <strong>commit</strong> is a snapshot of a repository that is entered into its permanent history. To commit a change to a repository, we take two steps:</p><p>\n1. Adding files to a \"staging area,\" meaning that we intend to commit them. </p><p>\n2. Finalizing the commit.</p><p>\nStaging a file or files is you telling Git, \"Hey! Pay attention these files and the changes in them\".</p><p>\nMaking a commit is a lot like taking a photo. First, you have to decide who will be in the photo and arrange your friends or family in front of the camera (the staging process). Once everyone is present and ready, you take the picture, entering that moment into the permanent record (the commit process).</p>\n<h2>Staging Changes with the Add Command</h2>\n<p>First, let's see what state Git is currently in. It's a good idea to use this command before and after doing anything in Git so you can always be on the same page as the computer.</p><p>\nMake sure you're in your <code>/home/&lt;your-name&gt;/Desktop/projects/git-practice</code> directory using the <code>pwd</code> command in the terminal. Once you're there, enter this command:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">git</span> <span class=\"n\">status</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>You should see output like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nv\">On</span> <span class=\"nv\">branch</span> <span class=\"nv\">master</span>\n<span class=\"nv\">No</span> <span class=\"nv\">commits</span> <span class=\"nv\">yet</span>\n<span class=\"nv\">Untracked</span> <span class=\"nv\">files</span>:\n  <span class=\"ss\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">use</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">git add &lt;file&gt;...</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span> <span class=\"nv\">to</span> <span class=\"k\">include</span> <span class=\"nv\">in</span> <span class=\"nv\">what</span> <span class=\"nv\">will</span> <span class=\"nv\">be</span> <span class=\"nv\">committed</span><span class=\"ss\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"nv\">syllabus</span>.<span class=\"nv\">md</span>\n<span class=\"nv\">nothing</span> <span class=\"nv\">added</span> <span class=\"nv\">to</span> <span class=\"nv\">commit</span> <span class=\"nv\">but</span> <span class=\"nv\">untracked</span> <span class=\"nv\">files</span> <span class=\"nv\">present</span> <span class=\"ss\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">use</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">git add</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span> <span class=\"nv\">to</span> <span class=\"nv\">track</span><span class=\"ss\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This means we've initialized our repository, but haven't made any commits yet. If you're instead getting a message that begins with the word <code>fatal</code> when you use <code>git status</code>, you may be in the wrong directory or perhaps you haven't run the <code>git init</code> command on your directory yet.</p><p>\nLet's follow the recommendation in the status message above and use the <code>add</code> command to stage files, making them ready to be committed.</p><p>\nType this command:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">git</span> <span class=\"k\">add</span> <span class=\"n\">syllabus</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">md</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>You should see no output from the command line, meaning that the above command succeeded.

There's only one commit here now, though. If you don't see a prompt (the <code>$</code>) after running <code>git log</code>, you may need to press the <code>q</code> key (just the <code>q</code> key by itself) to return to the command line.</p>\n<h2>Why Do We Need to Use the -m Flag?</h2>\n<p>The -m flag is useful for human purposes and technical purposes. For human purposes, the -m flag helps you keep track of the changes you're making. Version control is most useful when you can confidently return to a specific version. It can also help you be more structured in your approach to making changes - your notes to self are limited, so to make them clear you might make commits after specific tasks are completed, such as update readings for week 1 or added S.Noble reading. This can also make it easier to reverse a specific change in the future. </p><p>\nAlso, if you type <code>git commit</code> by itself, git will open the command line's default text editor to allow you to enter the commit message. Unfortunately, the default text editor, <code>vi</code>, requires some knowledge to use, and we don't teach it as part of our sessions.</p><p>\nIf you find yourself stuck in an unfamiliar screen in the command line after running <code>git commit</code>, you're probably in <code>vi</code>. Type this to leave that environment and return to the <code>$</code> prompt:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">q</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you're ever stuck or \"trapped\" on the command line, try running through these common exit commands to return to the prompt:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">Control</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"k\">c</span>\n<span class=\"n\">Control</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">d</span>\n<span class=\"n\">q</span>\n<span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">q</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p><code>Control-c</code> attempts to abort the current task and restore user control. <code>Control-d</code> escapes the current shell environment—if you use it at the normal <code>$</code> prompt, it will end the current command line session. <code>q</code> is used to escape from specific utilities like <code>less</code>. <code>:q</code> first changes the mode in <code>vi</code>, allowing you to enter the <code>q</code> key to quit, so it's a command specific to <code>vi</code>.</p>",

Note that this process is very slightly different. I'll highlight it when it comes up. </p><p>\nTo start, let's add something to our syllabus. Another week of materials or a new reading. </p><p>\nSave that file. </p><p>\nUse <code>git add</code> via the command line to stage the file - tell Git what document you want it to pay attention to. </p><p>\nUse <code>git commit</code> via the command line to save the changes you've just made as a snapshot or new version of you file. Remember to use the -m flag and include a message about the change you just made. </p><p>\nSo far, we have not done anything with GitHub or on the Internet. We have used Git, installed on our local machine, to save a version of file as it stands now. We could stop here if we only had an interest in using Git for version control. But if we also wanted to use GitHub to back up our files, or to share our project with a team or publicly, we want to upload, or push, that repository to GitHub on the Internet. </p><p>\nUse <code>git push origin master</code> to push that file to your repository on GitHub. After refreshing the webpage, your file should appear online. <strong>The difference I noted above appears here.</strong> Note the absense of the <code>-u</code> flag from the command. That flag was used the first time to establish the connection between the repository on your local machine and on GitHub. Now that that connection has been established, that flag is not needed.   </p>",

            "text": "<p>GitHub was built for sharing and collaborating on projects. A key advantage of the platform is that you can find lots of bits of software that do many different things - such as code for plugins for WordPress or Leaflet. Increasingly, you might find syllabi or open writing projects. If a project is public, you can save a copy of it to your loca machine, work on it, save your admendations and share it on your own GitHub account. Like we've already mentioned, GitHub usefully helps track attribution along the way.</p><p>\nCloning and forking are the basic functions of this capability. Each are first explained below, and followed by an example and activity to further explain. </p>\n<h2>Cloning</h2>\n<p><strong>Cloning</strong> a repository means making a copy of a repository on GitHub, to download and work on locally - on your local machine. By entering the following code into your terminal, you can clone any public directory on GitHub: </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">git</span> <span class=\"n\">clone</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">repository</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">url</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>When you clone a repository from GitHub, the folder that shows up on your local machine comes built-in with a few things. First, Git is already present, so you don't need to initialize the folder. Also, the connection between your local copy and the online repository is already made, so <code>git push origin master</code> will work (no -u flag needed). </p><p>\nFor practice, let's clone the repository for this workshop about Git and GitHub.</p><p>\nFirst, let's navigate back to your Desktop folder.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">cd</span> <span class=\"o\">~/</span><span class=\"n\">Desktop</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Remember that the ~ refers to your home directory. Now let's find the URL we need to clone the lesson.</p><p>\nFirst, follow <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git\">this link to the main page of this lesson on Git and GitHub</a>.</p><p>\nOn the main page, there should be a green <code>Clone or download</code> button on the right side:</p><p>\n<img alt=\"Image pointing out where the clone or download button is on GitHub\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/git/clone.png\"/></p><p>\nClick the green button and you will see a box with highlighted text under a heading that says <code>Clone with HTTPS</code>. If you instead see <code>Cloning with SSH</code>, click the small link that says <code>Use HTTPS</code>.</p><p>\nNow copy out the text in the box:</p><p>\n<img alt=\"Image showing where the text you need to copy is located\" src=\"/static/images/lessons/git/copy-clone-text.png\"/></p><p>\nNow that you have the text copied, go back to your terminal. Remember, you should be on the desktop.</p><p>\nType</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">git</span> <span class=\"n\">clone</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">copied</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">url</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If the command is successful, the full Git lesson will be replicated on your local machine. You can type</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">cd</span> <span class=\"n\">git</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>to enter the lesson folder, since the lesson repository is simply called <code>git</code>. Use the <code>ls</code> command to take a look at the various files in the lesson folder.</p><p>\nCloning can be especially useful when you're joining a group project that is hosted on GitHub, and you want your changes to eventually be pushed and shared with that same repository. </p><p>\nBut maybe that is not possible or ideal. Maybe you don't want to contribute your changes to someone else's repository. Maybe you want to make a derivative of their folder for yourself, on your GitHub account, and make changes there.</p><p>\nForking is the step you could take before cloning to do this.</p>\n<h2>Forking</h2>\n<p><strong>Forking</strong> a repository means making a copy of someone else's repository on GitHub, and saving it to your account on GitHub. This function happens within GitHub, and has nothing to do with what is happening on your local machine. </p><p>\nFor example, go to <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git\">the repository for this workshop</a> on GitHub. Note the <code>Fork</code> button in the upper right hand corner.</p><p>\n<strong>ADD SCREENSHOT.</strong></p><p>\nBy clicking that button copying, or forking, this repository to your account. In the upper left hand corner, it would say your account name instead of <code>DHRI-Curriculum</code>, instead it will reference our account below after <code>forked from</code>. </p><p>\n<strong>ADD SCREENSHOT</strong></p><p>\nYour local machine would come into play when you want to <strong>clone</strong> that repository so you can work on it locally. This also means that when you push those changes to GitHub, you would be pushing them to a forked repository associated with your own account. </p><p>\nYou might use this method if you were going to teach your own Git &amp; GitHub workshop. You could use our repository as a base for getting started, and add more examples or change some language, clarify something further, or create a connection to another workshop you are giving, etc. This allows us to continue to use the workshop as we have it as well. Also, maybe at a later time, we want to merge some of your changes with ours. We can do that too by revisiting your version history. </p>",
