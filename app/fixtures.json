This approach relies on a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced \"gooey!\").\nToday we're going to explore another way to make your computer do things: through the command line. Instead of pointing and clicking, we'll be typing in either git bash (Windows) or terminal (macOS) to tell the computer directly what task we'd like it to perform.\nWhile this new technique can seem intimidating if you haven't used text-based interfaces before, luckily, you can use 90% of the functionality of the command line by becoming comfortable with a very small set of the most common commands.", "ethical_considerations": "\"The command line\" is also laden with masculine and military metaphors, which is reflective of the history of computing and programming.
