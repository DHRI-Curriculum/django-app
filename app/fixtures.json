We either simply stop working on them, or we forget about them, or we move on to something else. Few digital projects have an end \"form\" in the way that we think of a monograph. We rarely think of digital scholarship in its \"done\" form, but sooner or later even if they're not \"finished\"\u2014so to speak\u2014at some point, these projects end. </p><p>\nDone can take many different shapes: \n* it can morph into something new;\n* it can be retired;\n* it can be archived in a repository;\n* it can be saved on some form of storage media;\n* it can run out of funding; \n* and sometimes <strong>you</strong> are done with it!</p><p>\nSo it's helpful to think about what you want \"done\" to look like before you begin, because then you always have a sense of what will make a satisfactory ending to the work you're about to embark on. </p>\n<h2>Activity</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Imagine what your project is like when it's over. Imagine what it means to you to set it down and walk away. What will you do with it? How will you know if it succeded? Who was the last person to care about it? Why? </li>\n<li>Now, Describe your 2-3 sentences to a non-expert audience the purpose of your project. </li>\n<li>Does it solve a problem? </li>\n<li>Meet an institutional need? </li>\n<li>Put an existing resource to new use?</p><p>\n # Identifying Audiences, Constituencies, and Collaborators</li>\n<li>Who will participate in, use, and/or benefit from the project? </li>\n<li>Is there a specific group already asking for this new resource?

They are unable to update software frequently, but they can use web applications. </li>\n<li>Limitations: This audience needs clear and specific documentation and has a low threshold for errors. </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Sample 2:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Needs/Interest: My dissertation committee is interested in hearing how my model of financial data offers a new approach to predicting corporate fraud. </li>\n<li>Resources/Relationship: The committee is familiar with some of the models that already exist. They have deep familiarity with the qualitative indicators for corporate fraud. They can connect my data and my research to a wider community of scholars who have the datasets that I need to finish my work. My advisor wants me to succeed. </li>\n<li>Limitations: My committee is skeptical about technology and feels uncertain about how they will evaluate my work. They have expressed concern about not knowing how to \"check\" if the model is accurate. </p><p>\nIf you are working on a project that is institutionally based (such as creating a platform, creating a resource, or building a teaching tool), you may have institutaional partners who have a stake in your project's success.

Some funders want letters from all project participants. </p><p>\nIt is important to respect people\u2019s time when asking them for a letter by showing that you\u2019ve done your research and that you have some grant materials to share with them. Good letters demonstrate some knowledge of the project and recognition of its impact if funded. </p><p>\nFollow these steps when asking for a support letter and for specific types of assistance during the life of the grant, and you should receive a good letter in return.\n* One month before grant deadline, begin brainstorming candidates for letters of support and note which collaborators are required to submit letters of commitment and support. \n* Start asking supporters at least two weeks in advance of grant deadline, because they will also have deadlines and other work competing for their work hours. You may find some folks are on leave at the time you inquire, be sure to have back-ups on your list. \n* Email potential supporters, collaborators:</p><p>\n    * State why, specifically, you are asking Person A for support;</p><p>\n    * Be specific about what you are asking Person A to do over the scope of the grant, if anything, such as participate in 3 meetings, 2 phone calls over 18 months; or  agree to review the project and provide feedback one month before official launch; </p><p>\n    * Provide any information about compensation, especially when asking someone to participate (ie, there will be a modest honorarium to recognize the time you give to this project of $xxx);</p><p>\n    8 Tell supporters what exactly you need to complete the grant application, in what format, and by what date (ie, a 2-page CV in PDF and letter of support on letterhead by next Friday).\n* Attach materials that will be helpful for them when writing the letter.</p><p>\n    * Provide a short project summary that includes the project goals, deliverables, and work plan from the grant proposal draft;</p><p>\n    * Include a starter letter containing sample text that references that person\u2019s or institution\u2019s role and why they are supporting the project.</p>", "order": 7}}, {"model": "lesson.lesson", "pk": 98, "fields": {"title": "Finding Funding", "created": "2020-07-14T15:11:01.519Z", "updated": "2020-07-14T15:11:01.519Z", "workshop": 10, "text": "<p>Now that you have started to form:\n* a more refined project idea;\n* a wider awareness of the ecosystem of existing projects in your field;\n* a sense of the national, local, or institutional demand for your project;\n* and a clearer sense of the resources at your disposal</p><p>\n... the next step is to find an appropriate funding source. Below you will find some suggestions as to where to begin the search for funding. As you look for possible funders, below are some guidelines for the process:</p><p>\n1. Check federal, state, and local grant-making agencies, and local foundations for possibility of grants.</p><p>\n    * Federal agencies list all of their available grants on http://grants.gov.</p><p>\n    * States also have opportunities for grants, such as state humanities councils. </p><p>\n    * Private foundations are also possible areas to look. The following may prove useful: </p><p>\n        * The Foundation Center: [http://foundationcenter.org] (http://foundationcenter.org)</p><p>\n        * A Directory of State and Local Foundations: </p><p>\n        [http://foundationcenter.org/getstarted/topical/sl_dir.html] (http://foundationcenter.org/getstarted/topical/sl_dir.html)</p><p>\n        * The Council on Foundations Community Foundations List</p><p>\n     http://www.conf.org/whoweserve/community/resources/index.cfm?navitemNumber=15626#locator</p><p>\n     * The USDA offers a valuable Guide to Funding Resources [https://www.nal.usda.gov/ric/guide-to-funding-resources] (https://www.nal.usda.gov/ric/guide-to-funding-resources)</p><p>\n2. Check your institution\u2019s eligibility for a potential grants before beginning the application process. Eligibility requirements and restrictions are often found in grant guidelines.</p><p>\n3. Review the types of projects this program funds, and consider how your project fits with the agency or foundation\u2019s mission and strategic goals.</p><p>\n4. Review a potential grant program\u2019s deadlines and requirements (including proposal requirements and format for submission).</p><p>\n5. Identify funding levels/maxes, and keep them close at hand as you develop your budget.</p><p>\n6.
