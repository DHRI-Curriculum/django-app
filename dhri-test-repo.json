{"frontmatter": {"Abstract": "This discussion-based workshop will address an array of ethical questions and concerns for folks doing digital projects or research with an emphasis on consent, personhood, confidentiality, political economy, the politics of knowledge production, and accessibility. In addressing these issues, this workshop will first provide a general overview of ethics for institutional research compliance\u2014including the Belmont Report and Institutional Review Board\u2014and then delve into an array of ethical issues that extend beyond institutional rules.\nThe approach of this workshop is premised on the understanding that there is no simple roadmap for practicing 'good ethics' and, indeed, what constitutes 'good' or 'ethical' for one individual may vary from the next and is often reflective of a scholar's political commitments and personal background. Nonetheless, this workshop will foreground key ethical questions to ask (and keep asking!) when designing and doing digital projects or digital research, and key concepts to draw upon when thinking through these questions.", "Learning Objectives": "In this workshop, you will learn the following skills:\n- Identify existing resources (and maybe even a few you haven't thought of yet)\n- Identify your needs\n- Create a workplan\n- Find new resources\n- Communicate your plan", "Estimated time": "10 hours.", "Prerequisites": ["Intro to Python", "Title of required previous workshop"], "Pre-reading suggestions": ["Book about R"], "Projects that use these skills": ["Something cool"], "Ethical Considerations": ["Something scary"], "Resources (optional)": ["Links to required installations.", "Shortcut sheets."], "Acknowledgements": ["list each person who have contributed to this repository as a bullet point", "Firstname Lastname", "Firstname Lastname", "Firstname Lastname"], "Name": "Dhri Test Repo", "Parent repo": "kallewesterling/dhri-test-repo", "Parent backend": "Github", "Parent branch": "v2.0"}, "theory-to-practice": {"Suggested Further Readings": "(For instance)[https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/ethics/blob/master/sections/resources.md]\n- Use ## Suggested Further Readings to indicate the beginning of the section, and bullet points for each of the sources (in markdown, you use - on a new line to create a bullet point).\n- If the reading has a DOI number, make sure to add it.

These qualitative questions (of course) do not need to have answers but should enable the learner to think about what they learned and how it can be used.\n- If you think of readings/tutorials/projects/challenges from the \"Theory to Practice\" section to direct them to, and add a note of that as a bullet point under relevant questions."}}
