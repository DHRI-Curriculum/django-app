    blurb:
      text: My interests in digital humanities emerges at the intersection of digital archives and website development. I am particularly inspired by the ways in which digital archives like the South Asian American Digital Archive, the HathiTrust Digital Library, and Chronicling America, among many others, provide us with relatively easy access to an abundance of historical documents. I am eager to learn new ways of creatively using the materials provided by these digital archives to curate historical moments and raise cultural questions. These interests started to shape up during my first year as a graduate student, when I worked on a digital exhibition project called Latin American Jewish Writers and Artists. This opportunity allowed me to work with research conducted over many decades to preserve the cultural heritage of the Latin American Jewish community. I was part of the team that decided how the videos, images, and documents in this collection would be presented to the public. The discussions we had regarding the design and layout of the website often led to discussions of larger issues of cultural significance, politics, and memory. I found the whole exercise to be immensely intellectually enriching and I’ve been teaching and learning with websites and digital archives ever since.

    bio: Di is currently a PhD student at CUNY, The Graduate Center (GC). They are also a GC Digital Initiatives Digital Fellow. Broadly, their work is on understanding the relationality between systems of oppression and the individual. They are interested in identities as discourses, and the ties between transnationalism and diasporas. Currently, they are working on several projects that is exploring identities as discourses, including in alt-right spaces, K-pop/Hallyu, and the experiences of queer and trans Asian (American) in the US.<br /><br />As a GC Digital Initiatives Digital Fellow, they are also interested in understanding what ethics is within computational social science, digital humanities, and public humanities projects. They are also invested in bridging the gaps of technology literacy, especially within underserved communities.

    blurb:
      text: My first foray into data literacies began when I was considering the ethics of conducting a digital oral history archival project. Concerned with how my oral history interviews with queer and trans Asians may be manipulated or remixed without consent, I began to actively look for answers to my questions on doing digital projects with marginalized communities. This led to no easy answers, and I found myself at the beginning of a very complex but necessary journey through data literacies and ethics. What did become clear is that ethical considerations cannot stop at an IRB but has to be negotiated at every step of the way. Important questions that emerged in my process are:<br />a) Am I comfortable with the unintentional use of my data/results/analyses?<br />b) Who is benefiting from my project?, and<br />c) Who is left out in my analysis?<br />As we are living in a data saturated world, these questions also help in keeping me grounded and accountable. These questions also reflect the complexities of ethics in a digital project; there is no universal fit or easy answers. Drawing on my experiences, the workshop on data literacies will begin with exploring some of these concerns."

    blurb:
      text: "As someone from a humanities and literary background, programming languages were not something I had interest in learning, let alone teaching. My entry into digital humanities began with an unexpected experience on a classroom project with TEI (a markup language similar to HTML), where I encoded a heavily revised manuscript into electronic format. With time and effort, I marked up each detail of the manuscript, and to my surprise, I was totally immersed in this close and careful work and in the production of a concrete piece of textual scholarship. I looked into more digital humanities tools, and eventually, I inherited this Python workshop from a former digital fellow. In learning Python, I rediscovered the satisfaction that comes with the slow progress of building toward something, of making a concrete thing, like a program that scrapes the web or cleans text. For someone who spends a lot of time discussing and writing about (and often getting carried away with) theory and criticism, learning languages like Python has been a nice reorientation toward the matter of my research, reminding me to focus on the text and my engagement with it as the ground for scholarship."

      text: "I started learning Python not long ago. At first, I was trying to learn how to do quantitative analysis without spending lots of money on proprietary software (Good bye, SPSS!). I found out about the Python Users' Group and started coming for their meetings. I immediately got amazed by their willingness to help me as a complete newbie who had no idea what was doing. One thing led to another, and I became a Digital Fellow! Now, I am the one excited to help beginners learn Python.<br /><br />The next step was to learn to do text-analysis, which I knew had incredible tools for academic research. My first step was to take this very workshop you have in front of you! (I mean, an older version of it). I redid it a couple times to feel confident. Later, I took a course in the Digital Humanities Summer Institute. Since then, I've been teaching text analysis workshops, and using it on personal projects. I don't feel like an expert by any means, and that is not me being humble. There is just so much out there to learn, some of which is very complex and complicated. However, I feel confident that I now know enough to be able to find and learn things by myself, and that is exactly where I want all my students to be."

      text: "My first memories of using the command line date back to 1994, when my older brother first introduced me to a Windows computer. I was seven years old and beside learning a few commands to run some maintenance utilities, my relationship with the command line didn’t progress very much at all until my days as a graduate student. In January 2018, I refreshed my memory through a workshop at the GCDI Digital Research Institute, before having the opportunity (and the need) to apply my newly learned skills to interact with a web server to install Omeka for the East Bay Punk Digital Archive. I now regularly use the command line to manage the installation of server-side software applications, plugins, and tools."

    blurb:
      text: "I slowly got into building websites and web-based projects. It started with using WordPress to build a public profile to share my work and research interests. Over time, it has melded into a critical component of my approach to public scholarship and education. A critical step in this evolution was attending the DRI where I gained a foundational understanding of the larger ecosystem of digital tools of which WordPress was one small part. Critical for me was understanding the different affordances and relationships between different digital tools and environments. I now understand a lot more of what I’m doing, technically, when I’m working with those tools. This helps me in understanding what tools I need for a specific task and how they could be integrated to best support my ambitions for a project, and what work-arounds I might explore if needed. Sometimes it can still be a headache, but definitely less so with time, and I’ve learned to reframe the frustration as an opportunity to reach out to colleagues and/or learn a new tool or technique. And the rewards of doing this work over time are evident today: my dissertation includes a web-based project that integrates a few different tools already, with plans for expansion (https://recalibratingqueens.nyc) and I work as a consultant on multiple web-based projects."
