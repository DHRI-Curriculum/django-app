      "## What is Git? \n",
      "**Git** is software used for version control—that is, tracking the state of files and changes you make to them over time. Git can be enabled in a folder, and then used to save the state of the contents in that folder at different points in the future, as designated by you. In the language of Git, a folder is called a *repository*. In the context of this workshop, it refers to a folder that is being tracked by Git. Using Git, you can view a log of the changes you've made to the files in a repository and compare changes over time. You can also revert back to previous versions, and create branches of a project to explore different futures. Git is also useful for collaboration, as a repository can be shared across computers, and its contents can be asynchonously developed and eventually merged with the main project. \n",
      "## What is GitHub?\n",
      "**GitHub** is a online platform for hosting Git repositories. It functions for some, predominantly programmers, as a social network for sharing and collaborating on code-based projects. Users can share their own projects, as well as search for others, which they can then often work on and contribute to. Digital Humanists, librarians, and other academics are also finding ways Git and GitHub are useful in writing projects and teaching. GitHub also serves as a web-hosting platform, allowing users to create websites from their repositories.\n",
      "## What is Markdown?\n",
      "Markdown is a markup language for formatting text. Like HTML, you add markers to plain text to style and organize the text of a document.\n",
      "In HTML: \n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "html\n",
      "done\n",
      "In Markdown:\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "md\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "A [study of how Digital Humanists use GitHub](https://digitalscholarship.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/spirosmithdh2016githubpresentationfinal.pdf), conducted by Lisa Spiro and Sean Morey Smith, found that a wide range of users, including professors, research staff, graduate students, IT staff, and librarians commonly used the site in their DH work. They used GitHub for a diverse range of activities, such as:\n",
      "- Developing software\n",
      "- Sharing data sets\n",
      "- Creating websites\n",
      "- Writing articles and books\n",
      "- Collating online resources\n",
      "- Keeping research notes\n",
      "- Hosting syllabi and course materials\n",
      "## Why Use GitHub?  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Participants in the study said they found GitHub useful in their Digital Humanities work for several reasons. In particular, it facilitated: \n",
      "- Sharing and backing up files on multiple computers\n",
      "- Monitoring changes effectively\n",
      "- Recovering from bugs or errors by going back in time before the error arose\n",
      "- Using different branches for experiments and new directions\n",
      "- Sharing and managing files with others—seeing who added what content and when\n",
      "## How We Use GitHub:\n",
      "### Sharing and Attribution\n",
      "As you can see across these sessions, we use GitHub to host workshop curricula. Hosting sessions on GitHub allows you (and anyone else interested in these topics!) to follow our repositories, and create your own version of the workshop based on our materials. This fosters open scholarship and knowledge sharing. It also facilitates attribution and citation by clearly tracking which content was created by whom, when it was added, and which projects or materials are derived from others.\n",
      "#### Case One: This Session\n",
      "If you look just under the workshop title, `DHRI-Curriculum/git` at the top of this page, you can see it is `forked from pswee001/Git_DRI_Jan_2018`. That line shows that this particular repository is building on (*\"forked from\"*) the curriculum for a session I presented at our January 2018 Institute. If you then look at that repository, you will see that it is in turn forked from previous sessions that were developed by other GC Digital Fellows for workshops in past years. \n",
      "**Forking** is a proper function of the GitHub platform. It supports collaboration by allowing you to copy someone else's repository to your own account on GitHub while maintaining a trail of attribution and derivation. This function is described in further detail in the final lesson of this workshop.\n",
      "### Collaborative Writing\n",
      "Git is also used to track changes (*version control* in Git parlance) in writing projects, especially when there are multiple authors working asynchronously. It can be an alternative to using track changes in Microsoft Word, or comments and edits in a Google Doc.\n",
      "#### Case Two: Coauthored Publications\n",
      "Git and GitHub - together or independently - support multi-author publishing. Like we have done with the DHRI curriculum, you can have a shared project folder that multiple people are working from asynchronously, even on the same parts if they wanted, and then those different offshoots can be carefully folded back into the master project. This entails the process of creating *branches* and *merging*.\n",
      "Git and GitHub also help with attribution by tracking individual contributions throughout. Additional branches could be created by a singular author as well, allowing the writer to explore different ways forward. The version control feature also allows authors to easily return to and compare older drafts or retrieve sections previoulsy discarded. \n",
      "**Branches** and **merging** are important functionalities when using Git to collaborate, but they are also advanced and thus beyond the scope of this workshop. See the *Resources* section at the end of the workshop for more information.\n",
      "### Versions Across Time\n",
      "How did you initially come by the syllabus you use for your class, and did you develop it over time? Many professors borrow and adapt from each other, and most of us probably update our syllabi each semester, even if only a little bit.\n",
      "Put your hand up if you have a folder somewhere that looks something like this. Or even multiple folders. \n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "Ok, hands down. \n",
      "**Consider the following questions as well:**\n",
      "- Can you remember who you initially got this syllabus from?\n",
      "- Do you know if there were other contributors along with or before them? \n",
      "- Do you acknowledge prior contributors somewhere on your syllabus? \n",
      "- Can you or others see what changes have been made to the syllabus over time? \n",
      "#### Case Three: Syllabi\n",
      "Increasingly we see that faculty are sharing their syllabi on GitHub. Some are even using GitPages that apply a user-friendly interface to their repository to make it easier to access and navigate for their students. This is because Git and GitHub make it easy to make contributors and changes to documents over time visible. \n",
      "Using Git and GitHub, you could fork that syllabi to your account, and download - or *clone* as Git calls it - it to your local machine to edit. After making changes to the files and and reuploading them or *pushing* them to the repo (short for repository) on GitHub, someone else could compare the changes you made and see who the original or additional contributors were. They could also decide to continue the chain by copying or forking your version, or decide to return to the original repo and fork that version. Both Git and GitHub help with attribution here; tracking who changes and adds what is a key feature of both tools.\n",
      "Even if you were only working with your own self-created syllabus, like we'll do later in this workshop, Git and GitHub can be useful for tracking your changes without the hassle of multiple files. From one file, you can use Git to compare your current version with older versions; you can also compare and share these different versions on GitHub.\n",
      "**Cloning** and **pushing** are proper functionalities of GitHub that describe how you communicate and share files between your local machine and the Internet. These are covered more in-depth in a later lesson in this workshop.\n",
      "# Review of the Command Line\n",
      "During this workshop, you'll be communicating with GitHub from our local machine via the command line (terminal, bash). It will be useful if you've taken [the Command Line Workshop](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/command-line) before continuing. This section reviews some of the basic commands that will also be used in this workshop.  \n",
      "In addition to the command line, you'll be using your text editor and your browser. Before continuing, its important that we clearly distinguish between these three different spaces or environments:\n",
      "- Your plain text editor where you'll be writing your syllabus in Markdown is on your local machine. \n",
      "- That syllabus is intiailly saved in a git-enabled repository on your local machine.\n",
      "- Your browser is where you'll be uploading your repository to GitHub.\n",
      "- Your terminal is where you'll be communicating with GitHub to send the repository and project files back and forth between the web and your hard drive. \n",
      "Because you'll be moving between these three spaces throughout the workshop, you may want to use (command + tab) or (ctrl + tab) to move quickly between the three windows on your desktop.\n",
      "## Accessing the Terminal\n",
      "### Mac OS\n",
      "Press the space bar and the command key at the same time and type `terminal`. Press `Enter`.\n",
      "### Windows\n",
      "Press the Windows button on your keyboard. When the search menu pops up, type `git bash` and press `Enter`.\n",
      "## Practice Navigating the Command Line\n",
      "In this session, we will be making a syllabus and using Git to keep track of our revisions. Let's create a Git project folder\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "will let you navigate inside a directory of your choosing.\n",
      "Type \n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "and hit `Enter`. This will change your current working directory from `/Users/<your-name>` to `/Users/<your-name>/Desktop`.\n",
      "To check your current directory, type\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "Try this now to make sure you're in your Desktop directory.\n",
      "Now, use \n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "to go up one directory. In this case, this will take you back to your home directory.\n",
      "Practice going back and forth between your Desktop and your home directory.\n",
      "When finished, go to your Desktop folder and check that you're there with `pwd`.\n",
      "## Making a Git Project Folder\n",
      "If you've worked through the command line session, you should see a `projects` folder on your desktop. Navigate into it with\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "If you don't have a projects folder on your desktop, create one with\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "From `Desktop`, navigate into your `projects` folder. Then create a `git-practice` folder with the below command:\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "Enter the new `git` folder with\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "At this point, when you type `pwd`, your folder structure should look like this:\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "# Setting Up Git\n",
      "Our first step in working with Git is letting the software know who we are so it can track our work and attribute our contributions. Through this section, you'll be checking your installation and configuring Git with your own name and information.\n",
      "## Check Your Install\n",
      "Let's make sure Git has been successfully installed. In your terminal, type\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "If you see a version number, you're all set. If not, click [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and install as you would any other software on your system.\n",
      "## Configuring Git on Your Computer\n",
      "Next, let's configure git so that it can identify who we are. This information is useful because it connects identifying information with the changes you make in your repository. \n",
      "Type the following into your command line, filling in the sections—below labeled \"John Doe\"—for your name and email (use quotations where you see them). This does not necessarily need to be the name and email you used to sign up for GitHub. Remember, these are different spaces and softwares.\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "To check your set-up, use:\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "You'll get something that looks like this:\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "# Creating a Syllabus with Markdown\n",
      "Using `cd`, navigate to the `git-practice` folder inside `projects`. From your home directory, type:\n",
      "\tcd Desktop/projects/git-practice\n",
      "Now we're going to **initialize** our repository, which means telling Git to pay attention to it:\n",
      "\tgit init\n",
      "You should see output like this:\n",
      "\tInitialized empty Git repository in /home/patrick/projects/git/.git/\n",
      "\t\n",
      "Now Git is tracking our directory. Importantly, it has not done any versioning yet. There is no history of changes as of yet: 1) because there are no files and we haven't made any changes, 2) becuase we have to tell Git when to take a snapshot, which we go through in the next section. For now, Git knows this folder exists and is prepared to take a snapshot of the files when you tel it to.\n",
      "Before version control useful, we'll have to create a text file for Git to track. For this session, the file we'll track will be a course syllabus—we'll create that next.\n",
      "### Creating a Syllabus in Markdown\n",
      "To create a plain text file, we're going to switch to our text editor, VS Code, to create and edit a file named `syllabus.md` and save it to our 'git-practice' folder. If you have not installed VS Code, review [the installation instructions here](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/vscode.md).\n",
      "In terminal, check to make sure you are in your `git-practice` folder. (HINT: use 'pwd' to see what directory you are currently in) Next, type:\n",
      "\tcode syllabus.md\n",
      "\t\n",
      "to open a `syllabus.md` file in VS Code. You should see a window appear that looks similar to this:\n",
      "![Image of what VS Code looks like when opening the syllabus.md file](../images/vscode1.png)\n",
      "If VS Code does not open when you use the `code` command in your terminal, open it using the Start Menu on Windows or Spotlight Search on Mac OS as you would any other software. Then click `File > Open File` and use the dialog to navigate to the `/Users/<your-name>/Desktop/projects/git` folder and create a `syllabus.md` file there.\n",
      "We'll be typing our markdown into this file in the VS Code window. At any time, you can save your file by hitting `Control-s` on Windows or `⌘-s` on Mac OS. Alternatively, you can click the `File` menu on the top right, then select `Save` from the dropdown menu.\n",
      "Saving frequently is advised. When we get to the version contol functionality of Git, only changes that are saved will be preserved when a version is created. \n",
      "## Using Markdown\n",
      "We'll be using markdown to write a syllabus, and then using Git to track any changes we make to it. Markdown allows us to format textual features like headings, emphasis, links, and lists in a plain text file using a streamlined set of notations that humans can interpret without much training. Markdown files usually have a `.md` extension.\n",
      "In markdown, we insert headings with a single hash mark like this:\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "A sub-heading (H2) heading uses two hash marks like this:\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "To provide emphasis, place asterisks around some text:\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "For emphasis, you need to mark where it should start and where it should end, so you need astrisks at the beginning and end of whatever text is being emphasized.\n",
      "To create a bulleted list, put a hyphen at the beginning of each list item:\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "To create a link, put the anchor text (the text you will see) in square brackets and the URL in parentheses. Don't put a space between them:\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "Paragraphs of text are denoted by putting a blank line between them:\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "Try using these five elements—headings, emphasis, lists, links, and paragraphs—to create a syllabus. Have a main heading that gives the course title (one `#`), then subheadings for, at least, course info and readings. Use emphasis (`*`) for book titles and try to get a list in there somewhere.\n",
      "You can look at an example syllabus in raw text form [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/master/sections/syllabus.md). When it's rendered by GitHub, it looks like [this](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/blob/master/sections/syllabus.md). When editing the markdown file in VS Code, it might look like this:\n",
      "![What your markdown might look like when typed into VS Code](../images/vscode2.png)\n",
      "VS Code also has a preview feature for your markdown. Hit the preview button on the top right while editing your markdown file:\n",
      "![Button to hit to get a preview in VS Code](../images/vscode3.png)\n",
      "You'll get two side-by-side panels. Your markdown file will be on the left, and your rendered preview will be on the right:\n",
      "![Side by side markdown and preview in VS Code](../images/vscode4.png)\n",
      "Remember to save your work with `Control-s` on Windows or `⌘-s` on Mac OS.\n",
      "# Staging and Committing Changes\n",
      "Git's primary function is version control, or to track a project as it exists at different points in time. Now that we have a file to track—our markdown syllabus—let's use Git to save the current state of the repository as it exists now.\n",
      "## A Metaphor for Adding and Committing\n",
      "In Git, a **commit** is a snapshot of a repository that is entered into its permanent history. To commit a change to a repository, we take two steps:\n",
      "1. Adding files to a \"staging area,\" meaning that we intend to commit them. \n",
      "2. Finalizing the commit.\n",
      "Staging a file or files is you telling Git, \"hey! pay attention these files and the changes in them\". \n",
      "Making a commit is a lot like taking a photo. First, you have to decide who will be in the photo and arrange your friends or family in front of the camera (the staging process). Once everyone is present and ready, you take the picture, entering that moment into the permanent record (the commit process).\n",
      "## Staging Changes with the Add Command\n",
      "First, let's see what state Git is currently in. It's a good idea to use this command before and after doing anything in Git so you can always be on the same page as the computer.\n",
      "Make sure you're in your `/home/<your-name>/Desktop/projects/git-practice` directory using the `pwd` command in the terminal. Once you're there, enter this command:\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "You should see output like this:\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "This means we've initialized our repository, but haven't made any commits yet. If you're instead getting a message that begins with the word `fatal` when you use `git status`, you may be in the wrong directory or perhaps you haven't run the `git init` command on your directory yet.\n",
      "Let's follow the recommendation in the status message above and use the `add` command to stage files, making them ready to be committed.\n",
      "Type this command:\n",
      "\tgit add syllabus.md\n",
      "\t\n",
      "You should see no output from the command line, meaning that the above command succeeded. Let's run `git status` again to check if things have changed. You should see output like this:\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",

      "The `-m` flag provides a message along with the commit that will tell others—or remind a future version of yourself—what the commit was all about. Try not to type `git commit` without the `-m` flag for now—there's a note about this below.\n",

      "This is the log of commits, comprising a history of your repository. There's only one commit here now, though. If you don't see a prompt (the `$`) after running `git log`, you may need to press the `q` key (just the `q` key by itself) to return to the command line.\n",
      "## Why Do We Need to Use the -m Flag?\n",
      "The -m flag is useful for human purposes and technical purposes. For human purposes, the -m flag helps you keep track of the changes you're making. Version control is most useful when you can confidently return to a specific version. It can also help you be more structured in your approach to making changes - your notes to self are limited, so to make the clear you might make commits after specific tasks are completed, such as: update readings for week 1 - X Author added.This can also make it easier to reverse a specific change in the future. \n",
      "Also, if you type `git commit` by itself, git will open the command line's default text editor to allow you to enter the commit message. Unfortunately, the default text editor, `vi`, requires some knowledge to use, and we don't teach it as part of our sessions.\n",
      "If you find yourself stuck in an unfamiliar screen in the command line after running `git commit`, you're probably in `vi`. Type this to leave that environment and return to the `$` prompt:\n",
      "\t:q\n",
      "\t\n",
      "If you're ever stuck or \"trapped\" on the command line, try running through these common exit commands to return to the prompt:\n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "`Control-c` attempts to abort the current task and restore user control. `Control-d` escapes the current shell environment—if you use it at the normal `$` prompt, it will end the current command line session. `q` is used to escape from specific utilities like `less`. `:q` first changes the mode in `vi`, allowing you to enter the `q` key to quit, so it's a command specific to `vi`.\n",

      "Use `git commit` via the command line to save the changes you've just made as a snapshot or new version of you file. Remember to heed to -m and include a message about the change you just made. \n",
      "So far, we have not done anything with GitHub or on the Internet. We have used Git, installed on our local machine, to save a version of file as it stands how. We could stop here if we only had an interest in using Git for version control. But if we also wanted to use GitHub to back up our files, or to share our project with a team or publicly, we want to upload, or push, that repository to GitHub, which is accessible view the Internet. \n",
      "Use `git push origin master` to push that file to your repository on GitHub. After refreshing the webpage, your file should appear online. The difference I noted above appears here. Note the absense of the `-u` flag from the command. That flag established the connection between the repository on your local machine and on GitHub. After that, it knows where to push so it doesn't need that indication.   \n",

      "# Cloning & Forking\n",
      "GitHub was built for sharing and collaborating on projects. A key advantage of that platform is that you can find lots of bits of software that do many different things - such as code for plugins for WordPress or Leaflet. Increasingly, you might find syllabi or open writing projects. If a project is public, you can save a copy of it, work on it, save your admendations and share it on your own GitHub account. Like we've already mentioned, GitHub usefully helps track attribution along the say.\n",
      "Cloning and forking are the basic functions of this capability. Each are first explained below, and followed by an example and activity to further explain. \n",
      "## Cloning\n",
      "**Cloning** a repository means making a copy of a repository on GitHub, to download and work on locally - on your local machine. By entering the following code into your terminal, you can clone any public directory on GitHub: \n",
      "in codeblock\n",
      "\n",
      "done\n",
      "When you clone a repository from GitHub, the folder that shows up on your local machine comes built-in with a few things. First, Git is already present, so you don't need to initialize the folder. Also, the connection between your local copy and the online repository is already made, so `git push origin master` will work. \n",
      "For practice, let's clone the repository for this workshop about Git and GitHub.\n",
      "First, let's navigate back to your Desktop folder.\n",
      "\tcd ~/Desktop\n",
      "Remember that the ~ refers to your home directory. Now let's find the URL we need to clone the lesson.\n",
      "First, follow [this link to the main page of this lesson on Git and GitHub](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git).\n",
      "On the main page, there should be a green `Clone or download` button on the right side:\n",
      "![Image pointing out where the clone or download button is on GitHub](../images/clone.png)\n",
      "Click the green button and you will see a box with highlighted text under a heading that says `Clone with HTTPS`. If you instead see `Cloning with SSH`, click the small link that says `Use HTTPS`.\n",
      "Now copy out the text in the box:\n",
      "![Image showing where the text you need to copy is located](../images/copy-clone-text.png)\n",
      "Now that you have the text copied, go back to your terminal. Remember, you should be on the desktop.\n",
      "Type\n",
      "\tgit clone <copied-url>\n",
      "\t\n",
      "If the command is successful, the full Git lesson will be replicated on your local machine. You can type\n",
      "\tcd git\n",
      "\t\n",
      "to enter the lesson folder, since the lesson repository is simply called `git`. Use the `ls` command to take a look at the various files in the lesson folder.\n",
      "Cloning can be especially useful when you're joining a group project that is hosted on GitHub, and you want your changes to eventually be pushed and shared with that same repository. \n",
      "Forking is a step you migth take before closing, if you want to establish a separate home for the future changes you make to the repository on your GitHub account rather than push to an existing folder owned by someone else on GitHub. \n",
      "## Forking\n",
      "**Forking** a repository means making a copy of someone else's repository on GitHub, and saving it to your account on GitHub. This function happens within GitHub, and has nothing to do with what is happening on your local machine. \n",
      "For example, go to [the repository for this workshop](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git) on GitHub. Note the `Fork` button in the upper right hand corner. By clicking that button, you could fork, or copy, this repository to your account. In the upper left hand corner, it would say your account name instead of `DHRI-Curriculum`, instead it will reference our account below after `forked from`. \n",
      "Your local machine would come into play when you want to **clone** that repository so you can work on it locally. This also means that when you push those changes to GitHub, you would be pushing them to a forked repository associated with your own account. \n",
      "You might use this method is you were going to teach your own Git & GitHub workshop. You might want to use our repository as a base for getting started, but maybe you want to add more examples or changes some language, clarify something further, or create a connection to another workshop you are giving, etc. This allows us to continue to use the workshop as we have it as well. Or maybe at a later time, we want to merge some of your changes with ours. We can do that too by revisiting your version history. \n",
      "## Challenge\n",
      "As we're the end of this lesson, here's a challenge that tests how much you've learned through this introduction. \n",
      "1. Fork and clone [the repository for this workshop](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git). Note not only *what* you are doing, but also *where* you working when completing these two different tasks.\n",
      "2. Make changes to the files on your local machine. Remember to save them!\n",
      "3. Use the 3-step process of stage, commit and push to return the amended files to the repository on GitHub. \n",
