      "<h1>What are Git, GitHub and Markdown?</h1>\n",
      "<h2>What is Git?</h2>\n",
      "<p><strong>Git</strong> is software used for version control—that is, tracking the state of files and changes you make to them over time. Git can be enabled in a folder, and then used to save the state of the contents in that folder at different points in the future, as designated by you. In the language of Git, a folder is called a <em>repository</em>. In the context of this workshop, it refers to a folder that is being tracked by Git. Using Git, you can view a log of the changes you've made to the files in a repository and compare changes over time. You can also revert back to previous versions, and create branches of a project to explore different futures. Git is also useful for collaboration, as a repository can be shared across computers, and its contents can be asynchonously developed and eventually merged with the main project. </p>\n",
      "<h2>What is GitHub?</h2>\n",
      "<p><strong>GitHub</strong> is a online platform for hosting Git repositories. It functions for some, predominantly programmers, as a social network for sharing and collaborating on code-based projects. Users can share their own projects, as well as search for others, which they can then often work on and contribute to. Digital Humanists, librarians, and other academics are also finding ways Git and GitHub are useful in writing projects and teaching. GitHub also serves as a web-hosting platform, allowing users to create websites from their repositories.</p>\n",
      "<h2>What is Markdown?</h2>\n",
      "<p>Markdown is a markup language for formatting text. Like HTML, you add markers to plain text to style and organize the text of a document.</p>\n",
      "<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>In HTML: \n",
      "<span class=\"nt\">&lt;h1&gt;</span> Heading 1 <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>\n",
      "\n",
      "In Markdown:\n",
      "# Heading 1\n",
      "</code></pre></div>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Whereas you use HTML and CSS with WordPress, you use Markdown with GitHub. Markdown has fewer options for marking text than HTML. It was designed to be human-readable, meaning easy to write and edit. </p>\n",
      "<p>This file you are reading is written in markdown—<a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/master/sections/concept.md\">here</a> is what it looks like in its raw, unrendered form.</p>\n",
      "<p>Compare that with this - the source code for the GitHub page, written in HTML: view-source:https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git</p>\n",
      "<p>Markdown is also arguably more sustainable and accessible than formats like <code>.docx</code> because of its simplicity and related ability to be read across multiple platforms. Use of Markdown is also supported by document-conversion tools like <a href=\"https://pandoc.org/\">Pandoc</a> that can change a markdown file to an epub with one command entered into your terminal.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Highlighting Distinctions</h2>\n",
      "<p>As we move forward its important to make sure we're firm on the distinctions between the three different tools outlined above. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Git</strong> is a software that you use on your laptop, or your local computer/machine. The repository with your project's files is stored on your hard drive. You also edit the text files on your local machine using a plain text editor, which is another software on your local machine like VS Code. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>GitHub</strong> is a cloud-based platform that you access through your internet browser. Even though you physically are still in the same place, working on your laptop, you are no longer working on your local machine, you are on the Internet. This is a fundamentally different location than when you're working with your Git repository and editing and creating files in your plain text editor. With GitHub, you are uploading your repository - as described above - from your local machine to this platform on the Internet to be shared more broadly. You can also create private repositories if you want to use GitHub to backup a project.  </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Markdown</strong> is the language used to format the plain text files in your Git-enabled repository. GitHub reads this language so that the markups made to the file are rendered when you view your file on the platform (i.e. #headers appears as headers, links are inserted).</p>\n",
      "<h1>What You Can Do with Git and GitHub</h1>\n",
      "<p>A <a href=\"https://digitalscholarship.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/spirosmithdh2016githubpresentationfinal.pdf\">study of how Digital Humanists use GitHub</a>, conducted by Lisa Spiro and Sean Morey Smith, found that a wide range of users, including professors, research staff, graduate students, IT staff, and librarians commonly used the site in their DH work. They used GitHub for a diverse range of activities, such as:</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>Developing software</li>\n",
      "<li>Sharing data sets</li>\n",
      "<li>Creating websites</li>\n",
      "<li>Writing articles and books</li>\n",
      "<li>Collating online resources</li>\n",
      "<li>Keeping research notes</li>\n",
      "<li>Hosting syllabi and course materials</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<h2>Why Use GitHub?</h2>\n",
      "<p>Participants in the study said they found GitHub useful in their Digital Humanities work for several reasons. In particular, it facilitated: </p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>Sharing and backing up files on multiple computers</li>\n",
      "<li>Monitoring changes effectively</li>\n",
      "<li>Recovering from bugs or errors by going back in time before the error arose</li>\n",
      "<li>Using different branches for experiments and new directions</li>\n",
      "<li>Sharing and managing files with others—seeing who added what content and when</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<h2>How We Use GitHub:</h2>\n",
      "<h3>Sharing and Attribution</h3>\n",
      "<p>As you can see across these sessions, we use GitHub to host workshop curricula. Hosting sessions on GitHub allows you (and anyone else interested in these topics!) to follow our repositories, and create your own version of the workshop based on our materials. This fosters open scholarship and knowledge sharing. It also facilitates attribution and citation by clearly tracking which content was created by whom, when it was added, and which projects or materials are derived from others.</p>\n",
      "<h4>Case One: This Session</h4>\n",
      "<p>If you look just under the workshop title, <code>DHRI-Curriculum/git</code> at the top of this page, you can see it is <code>forked from pswee001/Git_DRI_Jan_2018</code>. That line shows that this particular repository is building on (<em>\"forked from\"</em>) the curriculum for a session I presented at our January 2018 Institute. If you then look at that repository, you will see that it is in turn forked from previous sessions that were developed by other GC Digital Fellows for workshops in past years. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Forking</strong> is a proper function of the GitHub platform. It supports collaboration by allowing you to copy someone else's repository to your own account on GitHub while maintaining a trail of attribution and derivation. This function is described in further detail in the final lesson of this workshop.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Collaborative Writing</h3>\n",
      "<p>Git is also used to track changes (<em>version control</em> in Git parlance) in writing projects, especially when there are multiple authors working asynchronously. It can be an alternative to using track changes in Microsoft Word, or comments and edits in a Google Doc.</p>\n",
      "<h4>Case Two: Coauthored Publications</h4>\n",
      "<p>Git and GitHub - together or independently - support multi-author publishing. Like we have done with the DHRI curriculum, you can have a shared project folder that multiple people are working from asynchronously, even on the same parts if they wanted, and then those different offshoots can be carefully folded back into the master project. This entails the process of creating <em>branches</em> and <em>merging</em>.</p>\n",
      "<p>Git and GitHub also help with attribution by tracking individual contributions throughout. Additional branches could be created by a singular author as well, allowing the writer to explore different ways forward. The version control feature also allows authors to easily return to and compare older drafts or retrieve sections previoulsy discarded. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Branches</strong> and <strong>merging</strong> are important functionalities when using Git to collaborate, but they are also advanced and thus beyond the scope of this workshop. See the <em>Resources</em> section at the end of the workshop for more information.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Versions Across Time</h3>\n",
      "<p>How did you initially come by the syllabus you use for your class, and did you develop it over time? Many professors borrow and adapt from each other, and most of us probably update our syllabi each semester, even if only a little bit.</p>\n",
      "<p>Put your hand up if you have a folder somewhere that looks something like this. Or even multiple folders. </p>\n",
      "<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">|</span>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Ok, hands down. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Consider the following questions as well:</strong>\n",
      "- Can you remember who you initially got this syllabus from?\n",
      "- Do you know if there were other contributors along with or before them? \n",
      "- Do you acknowledge prior contributors somewhere on your syllabus? \n",
      "- Can you or others see what changes have been made to the syllabus over time? </p>\n",
      "<h4>Case Three: Syllabi</h4>\n",
      "<p>Increasingly we see that faculty are sharing their syllabi on GitHub. Some are even using GitPages that apply a user-friendly interface to their repository to make it easier to access and navigate for their students. This is because Git and GitHub make it easy to make contributors and changes to documents over time visible. </p>\n",
      "<p>Using Git and GitHub, you could fork that syllabi to your account, and download - or <em>clone</em> as Git calls it - it to your local machine to edit. After making changes to the files and and reuploading them or <em>pushing</em> them to the repo (short for repository) on GitHub, someone else could compare the changes you made and see who the original or additional contributors were. They could also decide to continue the chain by copying or forking your version, or decide to return to the original repo and fork that version. Both Git and GitHub help with attribution here; tracking who changes and adds what is a key feature of both tools.</p>\n",
      "<p>Even if you were only working with your own self-created syllabus, like we'll do later in this workshop, Git and GitHub can be useful for tracking your changes without the hassle of multiple files. From one file, you can use Git to compare your current version with older versions; you can also compare and share these different versions on GitHub.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Cloning</strong> and <strong>pushing</strong> are proper functionalities of GitHub that describe how you communicate and share files between your local machine and the Internet. These are covered more in-depth in a later lesson in this workshop.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Review of the Command Line</h1>\n",
      "<p>During this workshop, you'll be communicating with GitHub from our local machine via the command line (terminal, bash). It will be useful if you've taken <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/command-line\">the Command Line Workshop</a> before continuing. This section reviews some of the basic commands that will also be used in this workshop.  </p>\n",
      "<p>In addition to the command line, you'll be using your text editor and your browser. Before continuing, its important that we clearly distinguish between these three different spaces or environments:\n",
      "- Your plain text editor where you'll be writing your syllabus in Markdown is on your local machine. \n",
      "- That syllabus is intiailly saved in a git-enabled repository on your local machine.\n",
      "- Your browser is where you'll be uploading your repository to GitHub.\n",
      "- Your terminal is where you'll be communicating with GitHub to send the repository and project files back and forth between the web and your hard drive. </p>\n",
      "<p>Because you'll be moving between these three spaces throughout the workshop, you may want to use (command + tab) or (ctrl + tab) to move quickly between the three windows on your desktop.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Accessing the Terminal</h2>\n",
      "<h3>Mac OS</h3>\n",
      "<p>Press the space bar and the command key at the same time and type <code>terminal</code>. Press <code>Enter</code>.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Windows</h3>\n",
      "<p>Press the Windows button on your keyboard. When the search menu pops up, type <code>git bash</code> and press <code>Enter</code>.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Practice Navigating the Command Line</h2>\n",
      "<p>In this session, we will be making a syllabus and using Git to keep track of our revisions. Let's create a Git project folder</p>\n",

      "<p>Practice going back and forth between your Desktop and your home directory.</p>\n",
      "<p>When finished, go to your Desktop folder and check that you're there with <code>pwd</code>.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Making a Git Project Folder</h2>\n",
      "<p>If you've worked through the command line session, you should see a <code>projects</code> folder on your desktop. Navigate into it with</p>\n",

      "<h1>Setting Up Git</h1>\n",
      "<p>Our first step in working with Git is letting the software know who we are so it can track our work and attribute our contributions. Through this section, you'll be checking your installation and configuring Git with your own name and information.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Check Your Install</h2>\n",
      "<p>Let's make sure Git has been successfully installed. In your terminal, type</p>\n",

      "<h2>Configuring Git on Your Computer</h2>\n",
      "<p>Next, let's configure git so that it can identify who we are. This information is useful because it connects identifying information with the changes you make in your repository. </p>\n",
      "<p>Type the following into your command line, filling in the sections—below labeled \"John Doe\"—for your name and email (use quotations where you see them). This does not necessarily need to be the name and email you used to sign up for GitHub. Remember, these are different spaces and softwares.</p>\n",

      "<p>Now Git is tracking our directory. Importantly, it has not done any versioning yet. There is no history of changes as of yet: 1) because there are no files and we haven't made any changes, 2) becuase we have to tell Git when to take a snapshot, which we go through in the next section. For now, Git knows this folder exists and is prepared to take a snapshot of the files when you tel it to.</p>\n",
      "<p>Before version control useful, we'll have to create a text file for Git to track. For this session, the file we'll track will be a course syllabus—we'll create that next.</p>\n",

      "<p>If VS Code does not open when you use the <code>code</code> command in your terminal, open it using the Start Menu on Windows or Spotlight Search on Mac OS as you would any other software. Then click <code>File &gt; Open File</code> and use the dialog to navigate to the <code>/Users/&lt;your-name&gt;/Desktop/projects/git</code> folder and create a <code>syllabus.md</code> file there.</p>\n",
      "<p>We'll be typing our markdown into this file in the VS Code window. At any time, you can save your file by hitting <code>Control-s</code> on Windows or <code>⌘-s</code> on Mac OS. Alternatively, you can click the <code>File</code> menu on the top right, then select <code>Save</code> from the dropdown menu.</p>\n",
      "<p>Saving frequently is advised. When we get to the version contol functionality of Git, only changes that are saved will be preserved when a version is created. </p>\n",
      "<h2>Using Markdown</h2>\n",
      "<p>We'll be using markdown to write a syllabus, and then using Git to track any changes we make to it. Markdown allows us to format textual features like headings, emphasis, links, and lists in a plain text file using a streamlined set of notations that humans can interpret without much training. Markdown files usually have a <code>.md</code> extension.</p>\n",
      "<p>In markdown, we insert headings with a single hash mark like this:</p>\n",

      "<h1>Staging and Committing Changes</h1>\n",
      "<p>Git's primary function is version control, or to track a project as it exists at different points in time. Now that we have a file to track—our markdown syllabus—let's use Git to save the current state of the repository as it exists now.</p>\n",
      "<h2>A Metaphor for Adding and Committing</h2>\n",
      "<p>In Git, a <strong>commit</strong> is a snapshot of a repository that is entered into its permanent history. To commit a change to a repository, we take two steps:</p>\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li>Adding files to a \"staging area,\" meaning that we intend to commit them. </li>\n",
      "<li>Finalizing the commit.</li>\n",
      "</ol>\n",

      "<h1>Text as Data</h1>\n",
      "<p>When we think of \"data,\" we often think of numbers, things that can be summarized, statisticized, and graphed. Rarely when I ask people \"what is data?\" do they respond \"<em>Moby Dick</em>.\" And yet, more and more, text is data. Whether it is <em>Moby Dick</em>, or every romance novel written since 1750, or today's newspaper or twitter feed, we are able to transform written (and spoken) language into data that can be quantified and visualized.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Corpora</h2>\n",
      "<p>The first step in gathering insights from texts is to create a <strong>corpus</strong>. A corpus is a collection of texts that are somehow related to each other. For example, the <a href=\"https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/\">Corpus of Contemporary American English</a>, <a href=\"http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/\">Donald Trump's Tweets</a>, <a href=\"https://byts.commons.gc.cuny.edu/\">text messages</a> sent by bilingual young adults, <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers/\">digitized newspapers</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/\">books</a> in the public domain are all corpora. There are infinitely many corpora, and, sometimes, you will want to make your own—that is, one that best fits your research question.</p>\n",
      "<p>The route you take from here will depend on your research question. Let's say, for example, that you want to examine gender differences in writing style. Based on previous linguistic research, you hypothesize that male-identified authors use more definitives than female-identified. So you collect two corpora—one written by men, one written by women—and you count the number of <em>the</em>s, <em>this</em>s, and <em>that</em>s compared to the number of <em>a</em>s, <em>an</em>s, and <em>one</em>s. Maybe you find a difference, maybe you don't. We can already see that this is a relatively crude way of going about answering this question, but it is a start. (More likely, you'd use a <em>supervised classification task</em>, which you will learn about in the <a href=\"https://www.github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/machine-learning\">Machine Learning Tutorial</a>.)</p>\n",
      "<p>There has been some research about how the <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/331/6014/176.full.pdf\">linguistic complexity of written language</a> in long-form pieces (i.e., books, articles, letters, etc.) has decreased over time. Simply put, people today use shorter sentences with fewer embedded clauses and complex tense constructions than people did in the past. (Note that this is not necessarily a bad or good thing.) Based on this research, we want to know if short-form platforms are emblematic of the change (we predict that they are based on our own experience with short-form platforms like email and Twitter). One way to do this would be to use Part-of-Speech tagging. Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a way to identify the category of words in a given text.</p>\n",
      "<p>For example, the sentence:</p>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>I like the red bicycle.</p>\n",
      "</blockquote>\n",
      "<p>has one pronoun, one verb, one determiner, one adjective, and one noun.</p>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>(I : Pronoun), (like : Verb), (the : Determiner), (red : Adjective), (bicycle : Noun)</p>\n",
      "</blockquote>\n",
      "<p>NLTK uses the <a href=\"https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html\">Penn Tree Bank Tag Set</a>. This is a very detailed tag list that goes far beyond just nouns, verbs, and adjectives, but gives insight into different types of nouns, prepositions, and verbs as well. Virtually all POS taggers will create a list of (word, POS) pairs. If newspaper articles have a higher ratio of function words (prepositions, auxiliaries, determiners, etc.) to semantic words (nouns, verbs, adjectives), than tweets, then we have one piece of evidence supporting our hypothesis. It's important to note here that we must use either ratios or otherwise normalized data (in the sense that raw numbers will not work). Because of the way that language works (function words are often repeated, for example), a sample of 100 words will have more unique words than a sample of 1,000. Therefore, to compare different data types (articles vs. tweets), this fact should be taken into account.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Cleaning and Normalizing</h1>\n",
      "<p>Generally, however, our questions are more about topics rather than writing style. So, once we have a corpus—whether that is one text or millions—we usually want to clean and normalize it. There are three terms we are going to need:</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li><strong>Text normalization</strong> is the process of taking a list of words and transforming it into a more uniform sequence. Usually, this involves removing punctuation, making the words all the same case, removing <em>stop words</em>, and either <em>stemming</em> or <em>lemmatizing</em> the words. It can also include expanding abbreviations or matching misspellings (but these are advanced practices that we will not cover).</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<p>You probably know what removing punctuation and capitalization refer to, but the other terms may be new:</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>\n",
      "<p><strong>Stop words</strong> are words that appear frequently in a language, often adding grammatical structure, but little semantic content. There is no official list of stop words for any language, though there are some common, all-purpose lists built in to NLTK. However, different tasks require different lists. The purpose of removing stop words is to remove words that are so common that their meaning is diminished across a large number of texts.</p>\n",
      "</li>\n",
      "<li>\n",
      "<p><strong>Stemming and lemmatizing</strong> both of these processes try to consolidate words like \"laughs\" and \"laughing\" to  \"laugh\" since they all mean essentially the same thing, they are just inflected differently. So again, in an attempt to reduce the number of words, and get a realistic understanding of the meaning of a text, these words are collapsed. Stemming does this by cutting off the end (very fast), lemmatizing does this by looking up the dictionary form (very slow).</p>\n",
      "</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<p>Language is messy, and created for and by people, not computers. There is a lot of grammatical information in a sentence that a computer cannot use. For example, I could say to you:</p>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>The house is burning.</p>\n",
      "</blockquote>\n",
      "<p>and you would understand me. You would also understand if I say</p>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>house burn.</p>\n",
      "</blockquote>\n",
      "<p>The first has more information about tense, and which house in particular, but the sentiment is the same either way.</p>\n",
      "<p>In going from the first sentence to the normalized words, we removed the stop words (<em>the</em> and <em>is</em>), and removed punctuation and case, and lemmatized what was left (<em>burning</em> becomes <em>burn</em>—though we might have stemmed this, its impossible to tell from the example). This results in what is essentially a \"bag of words,\" or a corpus of words without any structure. Because normalizing your text reduces the number of words (and therefore the number of dimensions in your data), and keeps only the words that contribute meaning to the document, this cleaning is usually desirable.</p>\n",
      "<p>Again, this will be covered more in depth in the Machine Learning Tutorial, but for the time being, we just need to know that there is \"clean\" and \"dirty\" versions of text data. Sometimes our questions are about the clean data, but sometimes our questions are in the \"dirt.\"</p>\n",
      "<h2>Words into numbers</h2>\n",
      "<p>In the next section, we are going to go through a series of methods that come built-in to NLTK that allow us to turn our words into numbers and visualizations. This is just scratching the surface, but should give you an idea of what is possible beyond just counting words.</p>\n",
      "<h1>NLTK Methods with the NLTK Corpus</h1>\n",
      "<p>All of the code for this section is in a Jupyter Notebook in the GitHub repository. I encourage you to follow along by retyping all of the code, but if you get lost, or want another reference, the code is there as well.</p>\n",
      "<p>To open the notebook, first create a <code>projects</code> folder if you don't already have one by entering this command in your terminal:</p>\n",

      "<h1>Searching For Words</h1>\n",
      "<p>The first function we will look at is <code>concordance</code>. \"Concordance\" in this context means the characters on either side of the word. Our text is behaving like a string. As discussed in the <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/python\">Python tutorial LINK</a>, Python does not <em>evaluate</em> strings, so it just counts the number of characters on either side. By default, this is 25 characters on either side of our target word (including spaces).</p>\n",
      "<p>In the Jupyter Notebook, type:</p>\n",
      "<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">concordance</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;whale&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The output shows us the 25 characters on either side of the word \"whale\" in <em>Moby Dick</em>. Let's try this with another word, \"love.\" Just replace the word \"whale\" with \"love,\" and we get the contexts in which Melville uses \"love\" in <em>Moby Dick</em>. <code>concordance</code> is used (behind the scenes) for several other functions, including <code>similar</code> and <code>common_contexts</code>.</p>\n",
      "<p>Let's now see which words appear in similar contexts as the word \"love.\" NLTK has a built-in function for this as well: <code>similar</code>.</p>\n",

      "<p>Behind the scenes, Python found all the contexts where the word \"love\" appears. It also finds similar environments, and then what words were common among the similar contexts. This gives a sense of what other words appear in similar contexts. This is somewhat interesting, but more interesting if we can compare it to something else. Let's take a look at another text. What about <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>? Let's see what words are similar to \"love\" in Jane Austen's writing. In the next cell, type:</p>\n",

      "<h2>Investigating \"lol\"</h2>\n",
      "<p>Let's expand from novels for a minute and take a look at the NLTK Chat Corpus. In chats, text messages, and other digital communication platforms, \"lol\" is exceedingly common.

      "<h1>Positioning Words</h1>\n",
      "<p>In many ways, <code>concordance</code> and <code>similar</code> are heightened word searches that tell us something about what is happening near the target words. Another metric we can use is to visualize where the words appear in the text. In the case of <em>Moby Dick</em>, we want to compare where \"whale\" and \"monster\" appear throughout the text. In this case, the text is functioning as a list of words, and will make a mark where each word appears, offset from the first word. We will <em>pass</em> this <em>function</em> a <em>list</em> of <em>strings</em> to plot. This will likely help us develop a visual of the story - where the whale goes from being a whale to being a monster to being a whale again. In the next cell, type:</p>\n",

      "<p>Try this with <code>text2</code>, <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>. Some relevant words are \"marriage,\" \"love,\" \"home,\" \"mother,\" \"husband,\" \"sister,\" and \"wife.\" Pick a few to compare. You can compare an unlimited number, but it's easier to read a few at a time. (Note that the comma in our writing here is <em>inside</em> the quotation mark but for Python, this would be unreadable and you would have to put commas outside of quotation marks to create a <em>list</em>.)</p>\n",

Reading takes commands from you, the input is evaluated or run, the result is printed out, and the prompt is shown again to wait for more input. The normal terminal (the one with the <code>$</code>) is another example of a REPL. The REPL is the same thing as the Interactive mode, what we described earlier as the playground for running Python.

      "<h1>Running scripts</h1>\n",
      "<p>So far, you've interacted with Python one line at a time in the REPL. This is what we call the Interactive Mode, which is like a playground for experimenting and exploring different Python expressions,  like <code>2 + 2</code> or <code>type(\"some stuff\")</code>. The code that we write in the REPL is not saved after you exit, which means that this space is for running Python expressions and <em>not</em> for writing longer programs. </p>\n",
      "<p>For the rest of this session, we're going to expand beyond the REPL to write and execute longer programs. To do this, we will begin to work with text editor, where we write out longer Python scripts, and run those scripts from the terminal. </p>\n",
      "<p>This is a big move, so let's take it slow. The major change is that we will be working across two spaces, the terminal and the text editor, rather than just the terminal alone. We will be writing our scripts into the text editor, and using the terminal to run those scripts. </p>\n",
      "<h2>Your first script</h2>\n",
      "<p>First, let's begin with the text editor. Open your text editor of choice (such as VS Code) and create a new file with this line:</p>\n",
      "<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;Hello world!&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n",

      "</code></pre></div>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Once you're in the folder with your <code>hello.py</code> file, move to the terminal. Do <em>not</em> enter the Python Interactive Mode (the REPL), which is unecessary to run python scripts. Instead, lookout for the <code>$</code> symbol that lets you know you're in the terminal. If you find yourself in the Interactive mode (<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>), then exit it with <code>control-D</code>. You should see the <code>$</code> symbol, letting you know you're back in the terminal.  </p>\n",
      "<p>Now that you're in the terminal, type the following, and press enter:</p>\n",
      "<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> python hello.py\n",
      "<span class=\"go\">Hello world!</span>\n",
      "</code></pre></div>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>You should see the text <code>Hello world!</code> appear as output in the terminal window. </p>\n",
      "<p>There are a couple of important things to note here. First, it bears repeating that you are moving between two different spaces, the text editor and the terminal. You wrote your Python script in the text editor, and used the terminal to run the script. Second, within in the text editor, you included the <code>print()</code> function  because, unlike in the REPL, things aren't automatically printed out when writing scripts. When you're in the text editor, you always need to include the <code>print()</code> function so that your output will appear in the terminal. </p>\n",
      "<p>Congratulations! You've written your first script. That's kind of a big deal.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Challenges</h2>\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li>\n",
      "<p>Rewrite your program so that you assign the message to a variable, then print the variable. This will make your program two lines instead of one. There's a fancy programmer word for rewriting your code without changing it's behavior—\"refactoring.\"</p>\n",
      "</li>\n",
      "<li>\n",
      "<p>(optional) Are you already getting sick of typing <code>python hello.py</code> again and again? Try typing <code>!!</code> in the command line (the <code>$</code>). This will run your last line of code again.</p>\n",
      "</li>\n",
      "<li>\n",
      "<p>(even more optional) If you're on Windows and have a minute, try pressing the Windows button on your keyboard and searching for a program called <code>IDLE</code> that comes with Python. It's a special editor (or IDE) that lets you run Python code from inside it. You might like it more than git bash.</p>\n",
      "</li>\n",
      "</ol>\n",
      "<h2>A Note on Text</h2>\n",
      "<p>Fundamentally, Python programs are just text files. You can write them in any text editor, like VS Code or Notepad on Windows. When you pass the text file to Python, it runs the code in the file one line at a time. There's nothing special about <code>.py</code> files—they're just regular text files. This makes them work well with command line tools like Git. The tools you've learned so far—the command line, Git, markdown, grep—are all designed to work well together, and the medium through which they all work is plain text.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Errors in Python</h1>\n",
      "<p>Our usual response when seeing an error on a computer screen is a stress response. Our heart rate elevates and, if we cannot do what we were asking the computer to do, our frustration mounts. This is because many errors when interacting with programs are not useful or informative, and because we often have no capability to fix the program in front of us.</p>\n",
      "<p>In Python, errors are our friends. This might be hard to accept initially, but the errors you see when running Python scripts generally do a good job of pointing you to what's going wrong in your program. When you see an error in Python, therefore, try not to fall into the stress response you may be used to when interacting with your computer normally.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Two kinds of errors</h2>\n",
      "<p>In Python, there are two kinds of errors you will encounter frequently. One appears before the program runs, and the other appears during the execution of a program.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>syntax errors</strong> - When you ask Python to run a program or execute a line in the REPL, it will first check to see if the program is valid Python code—that is, that it follows the grammatical or syntactical rules of Python. If it doesn't, before the program even runs, you'll see a syntax error printed out to the screen.</p>\n",
      "<p>In this below example, the syntax error is a common one—mismatched single and double quotes, which is not allowed in Python. You can replicate the below error by opening the REPL (type <code>python</code> in the command line) and entering the line after the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt.</p>\n",
      "<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;This string has mismatched quotes. But Python will help us figure out this bug.&quot;)</span>\n",
      "  File <span class=\"nb\">&quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;</span>, line <span class=\"m\">1</span>\n",
      "    <span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;This string has mismatched quotes. But Python will help us figure out this bug.&quot;)</span>\n",
      "                                                                                           <span class=\"o\">^</span>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Note the caret (<code>^</code>) underneath the mismatched quote, helpfully pointing out where the error lies. Similarly, if this error happened when running a script, Python would tell us the filename and the line number for the line on which the error occurs.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Traceback errors</strong> - These errors occur during the execution of a Python program when the program finds itself in an untenable state and must stop. Traceback errors are often logical inconsistencies in a program that is valid Python code. A common traceback error is referring to a variable that hasn't been defined, as below.</p>\n",
      "<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">not_a_variable</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n",

      "</code></pre></div>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Traceback errors try to tell you a little about what happened in the program that caused the problem, including the category of error, such as <code>NameError</code> or <code>TypeError</code>.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Debugging</h2>\n",
      "<p>Debugging is a fancy word for fixing problems with a program. Here are some common strategies for debugging a program when first learning Python:</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>If the error is a syntax error, look at where the caret is pointing.</li>\n",
      "<li>If the error is a syntax error, pay attention to grammatical features such as quotes, parentheses, and indentation.</li>\n",
      "<li>If the error is a syntax error, consider reading the program, or the offending line, backward. It's surprising, but this often helps to detect the issue.</li>\n",
      "<li>If the error is a traceback error, first look at the line where the error occured, then consider the general category of error. What could have gone wrong?</li>\n",
      "<li>If the error is a name error (NameError), check your spelling.</li>\n",
      "<li>If the error is a traceback error, try copying the last line of the error and pasting it into Google. You'll often find a quick solution this way.</li>\n",
      "<li>If you changed the program and expect a different output, but are getting old output, you may not have saved the file. Go back and make sure the file has been correctly saved.</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<h2>Challenge</h2>\n",
      "<p>Try to create as many errors as you can in the next few minutes. After getting your first two syntax errors, try instead to get traceback errors. Some areas to try include mathematical impossibilities and using math operations on types that do not support them.</p>\n",

      "<h2>List Indexing</h2>\n",

      "<p>Websites seem like these magical things that appear when we open our web browser (i.e. Chrome, Firefox, Safari). We know that websites are hypertext, meaning that we can click between links, travelling from page to page until we find what we need. What may be less obvious about websites is that, fundamentally <strong>websites are plain text documents</strong>, usually written in HTML or another web-based markup language, such as XML or XHTML.</p>\n",
      "<p><em>Fun fact</em>: <strong>Nearly 80% of all websites (whose markup language we know) use HTML.</strong>\n",
      "<a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ml-html/all/all\">(w3techs.com)</a></p>\n",
      "<h2>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h2>\n",
      "<p>HTML is a markup language used to write web-based documents. It enables us to provide web browsers with information about the <em>content</em> of a document. We can, for example, indicate that some part of our document is a paragraph, image, heading, or link. The browser uses this information when displaying the document for users.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Markup language vs. programming Language</h2>\n",
      "<p>HTML is a <em>markup</em> language, not a programming language. Programming languages are used to transform data, by creating scripts that organize an output of data based on a particular input of data. A markup language is used to control the presentation of data.</p>\n",
      "<p>For a practical example of this difference, we can think about tables. A programming language can help you search through a table, understand the kinds of data the table includes, find particular data points, or transform its content into other kinds of data, such as frequencies. A markup language would instead determine the content, layout, and visual presentation of the table.</p>\n",
      "<p>Fundamentally, then, a script or program is a set of instructions given to the computer. A document in a markup language determines how information is presented to a user.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>NOTE - Markup vs Markdown:</strong> Markdown and HTML are both types of markup languages; Markdown is a play on words. Markup languages help format content.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>\n",
      "<p>CSS is usually used in conjunction with HTML. HTML tells the browser what the different parts of a document <em>are</em>. CSS tells the browser what the parts of the document should <em>look like</em>. It is essentially a set of rules that are applied when rendering an HTML document. Its name—Cascading Style Sheets—refers to the fact that there is an order of precedence in how the browswer applies CSS rules to a document. More specific rules overwrite less specific rules.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Where does the internet come in?</h2>\n",
      "<p>Together, these languages can be used to write and style a website using a text editor (such as VS Code) directly from your computer. No internet access needed.</p>\n",

      "<p>The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, or <strong>anchor tag</strong>, creates a link to another document. You can use the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag to link to other documents or webpages you created for the same site or to documents located elsewhere on the web. You can also use it to link to a particular location on a page—we'll see an example of this in the section on classes and ids.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Option One: Relative Links</h2>\n",
      "<p>Relative links take the current page as an origin point and search for other files within the same folder or directory. This method is useful for creating links to pages within your own site.</p>\n",
      "<p>The following appears as a link to the <code>about.html</code> page in the same folder as <code>index.html</code>:</p>\n",
      "<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">a</span> <span class=\"na\">href</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;about.html&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>About<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">a</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n",

      "<h2>Option Two: Absolute Links</h2>\n",
      "<p>An absolute link includes information that allows the browser to find resources on other websites. This information includes the site domain—such as <code>google.com</code>—and often the protocol—such as <code>http</code> or <code>https</code>.</p>\n",

      "<h2>More on links</h2>\n",
      "<p>Each example above includes an <code>href</code> tag. The <code>href</code> tag, short for hypertext reference, is an example of an <strong>attribute</strong>. Attributes offer secondary information about an element.</p>\n",
      "<p>The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, or anchor tag, creates a link. The text within the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code> tags, the anchor text, is what a visitor to the site will see and can click on. The <code>href=</code> attribute tells the browser where the user should be directed when they click the link.</p>\n",
      "<p>There is another technical difference between the two options above.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Relative vs. Absolute Links: When to use which</h2>\n",
      "<p>Use relative links when referring to pages on your own site. The main advantage of using relative links to pages on your site is that your site will not break if it is moved to a different folder or environment.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Activity</h2>\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li>Create a new text file called <code>about.html</code> in your <code>htmlpractice</code> folder. Copy over the HTML from your <code>index.html</code> file, but change the text in the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element to \"About.\"</li>\n",
      "<li>In your <code>index.html</code> file, add a relative link leading to your About page.</li>\n",
      "<li>Also add a relative link from your <code>About page</code> to your <code>index.html</code> page. In this link, call your <code>index.html</code> page <code>Home</code> (Reminder: <code>index.html</code> is the default homepage)</li>\n",

      "</ol>\n",
      "<h2>Check if it worked</h2>\n",
      "<p>When your pages are updated, you should be able to navigate from your Home page to your About page, and vice versa. You should also be able to navigate to the external web page.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Images</h1>\n",
      "<p>Images are another important component of websites. Sometimes these just help bring your website to life, but other times they can help communicate information to users.</p>\n",
      "<p>Images are created with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. Similar to the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> requires an attribute, in this case <code>src</code>. The <code>src</code> attribute stands for \"source\" and communicates secondary information to your browser that identifies and locates the image. Unlike many other tags, the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag does not need to be closed, making it an example of a void tag.</p>\n",
      "<p>The following element pulls in an image located in the same folder as the <code>.html</code> file:</p>\n",
      "<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">img</span> <span class=\"na\">src</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;scream.jpeg&quot;</span> <span class=\"p\">/&gt;</span>\n",
      "</code></pre></div>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The same rules apply here as with the <code>href</code> attribute: if the image is not located in the same folder as the document you are writing in, the browser won't find it. If the browser cannot find an image resource, you will see a broken image icon, such as this one from Chrome:</p>\n",
      "<p><img alt=\"Chrome broken image icon\" src=\"images/broken.png\" /></p>\n",
      "<p>Note: Some sites use a lot of images. When this is the case, it can be helpful to keep images in a separate folder within your site's structure. To enable the browser to find an image in that case, just add the directory in front of the file name. For example, if you have a folder named images in the same folder as your index.html file, and scream.jpeg is in that folder, you'd change the void tag above to <code>&lt;img src=\"/images/scream.jpeg\" /&gt;</code>.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Making images accessible</h2>\n",
      "<p>As briefly noted earlier, alternative text, or alt text, is descriptive \"text associated with an image that serves the same purpose and conveys the same essential information as the image\" (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Accessibility/Alternative_text_for_images\">Wikipedia Manual of Style/Accessibility/Alternative Text for Images</a> for more), and is important for ensuring content conveyed by images is accessible to all.</p>\n",
      "<p>To add alternative text to an image, you add an additional attribute, <code>alt</code> followed by your descriptive text. For example:</p>\n",
      "<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">img</span> <span class=\"na\">src</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;filename.png&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">alt</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;Text in these quotes describes the image&quot;</span> <span class=\"p\">/&gt;</span>\n",

      "<h2>What images can I use on my site?</h2>\n",
      "<p>If you're planning to use images that you did not take or make yourself, you'll need to use \"public domain\" or \"open license\" images.</p>\n",
      "<p>This <a href=\"https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/blog/help/following-copyright-guidelines-for-images/\">guide by the OpenLab at City Tech</a> includes more information on licensure and a list of places where you can find reuseable images.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Activity</h2>\n",
      "<p>Download and save an image from the web, or move an image from your computer into the same folder as your <code>index.html</code> file.</p>\n",
      "<p>Tip: Give the file a simple name. Also, the name <strong>cannot</strong> have spaces. A good practice is to use either dashes or underscores where there would otherwise be spaces. For example: <code>this-is-an-image.jpg</code> or <code>this_is_an_image.jpg</code>.</p>\n",
      "<p>Using the code above as a reference, add that image into your <code>index.html</code> file, re-save the file, and re-open or refresh the page in your browser. Your image should now appear on the page.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Conventions</h1>\n",
      "<p>As we’ve gone through the different components of creating a webpage, you likely have noticed some common conventions or industry standards for creating a webpage using HTML. Can you guess any of these?</p>\n",
      "<p>Here are a few examples:</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>Some tags are self-closing, while others require a closing tag. Self-closing tags are called void tags, and are generally self-closing because you wouldn't need or want to add another element within a tag. They also generally end with a backslash (<code>/</code>) to mark the end of the tag.</li>\n",
      "<li>Use lower case. While HTML is not case sensitive, it makes scanning the code easier, and makes it look more consistent.</li>\n",
      "<li>Your code should be nested. This is not a technical necessity either — blank space has no meaning in html. However, this makes it easier to scan the code quickly, which is particularly helpful when you run into errors!</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>...then the text of your paragraph would be green, but where the strong tag is found in the paragraph, the text would be bold and red. In other words, the more specific styling for the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> text in your paragraph will override the less specific styling of the paragraph in general. This would occur <strong>regardless of the order these rule sets appear in the stylesheet.</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>This rule also applies to how you integrate CSS into your HTML to style your content.

      "<p>Basically, if you're styling a part of your page that is unique, such as the navbar or footer, use an ID. If you're styling something that recurs in different places, like an info box or form field, use a class.</p>\n",

      "<p>Using the CSS basics we've just reviewed, and the list of properties found on the <a href=\"15-properties.md\">Properties page</a> and online, give your website some styling.</p>\n",

      "<p>Your first inclination should be to scan the text in your editor for errors. Nesting will help tremendously with this task. Oftentimes it is as little as forgetting a semicolon or closing tag.</p>\n",
      "<p>Another investigative tactic is to <strong>View Page Source</strong> on the page opened in the browser.</p>\n",
      "<p>If you think it is an <strong>error with the HTML</strong>, you'll be able to see it there.</p>\n",
      "<p>If you think it is an <strong>error with the CSS</strong>, then from the Page Source you'll need to click on the link for the <code>style.css</code> page. The link to this page should be found in the head of your page. Don't see it? That may be the problem! If you do see it, open the link to see what CSS the browser is reading and applying to your HTML. It should match what you have in your text editor. If it looks like an earlier version of your style sheet, then maybe you need to re-save the document.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Workshop Summary</h1>\n",
      "<p>Through this workshop, you have learned the basics of two of the most commonly-used languages for building on the web: HTML and CSS.</p>\n",
      "<p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, organizes content on your page using <a href=\"04-elements.md\">elements denoted by tags (<code>&lt; &gt;</code>)</a>. When rendered by your browser, these tags tell your browser that certain content is paragraph text, while other content is heading or title text, and so on. You can also use <a href=\"07-images.md\">image (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>)</a> and <a href=\"06-links.md\">link or anchor (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>)</a> tags to tell the browser to render an image on the page, or take the visitor to another page on your or another website. We also discussed some important <a href=\"08-conventions.md\">conventions</a> to consider when creating HTML documents, such as nesting.</p>\n",
      "<p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, allows for further styling of your website through the application of a series of <a href=\"12-rules.md\">rule sets</a> that are applied to different aspects/elements of your site. In order for CSS to render on a webpage, it must be <a href=\"11-integration.md\">integrated with your html</a>, which can happen in three ways: inline, internal, and external. CSS rules can be of varying specificity, and in particular, through creating <a href=\"14-classes.md\">classes and ids</a>. We also discussed how the ordering of rule sets doesn't matter, because an important function of CSS is the way it filters and applies rules in accordance with the specificity of the rule.</p>\n",
      "<p>Through understanding these languages in combination with one another, you can also reframe your understanding of the web—not as <em>poof! magic!</em>, but as a series of intentionally styled, hyperlinked text documents, with each website representing a folder of documents.</p>\n",
      "<p>While this is a good starting point, one important question remains: how can I get these text documents on the Internet so they can be accessed, and interacted with, and linked to by others?</p>\n",
      "<h1>Making your Website Public</h1>\n",
      "<p>Great job! Now you have an amazing website, but it's stuck on your computer where no one else can find it or view it. How do you get your website onto the Internet so it can be shared?</p>\n",
      "<p>To get your site on the internet, you'll need <strong>hosting</strong> — that is, a remote computer that will stay on day in and day out to serve the website to visitors. In theory, you could host your website on your own computer, but in practice, it usually makes sense to purchase hosting from a hosting company or use a free service.</p>\n",
      "<p>You'll also need a way of getting your website to your host. That's where FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, comes in.</p>\n",
      "<h2>FTP</h2>\n",
      "<p>FTP is a protocol used to share files from your computer (<em>a client</em>) to another computer called a server, and back again over the Internet. This is something we do ALL THE TIME, but we refer to it as \"uploading\" and \"downloading.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Note: Though FTP stands for file transfer protocol, you are not really transfering or moving your files from your computer; instead they are <em>copied</em> to the server. Fear not!</p>\n",
      "<p>In order to transfer your website files (also called your website's directory) to a server you will need:</p>\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li>Access to the Internet.</li>\n",
      "<li>An FTP Client.</li>\n",
      "<li>A server that is connected to the Internet where you can send your files.</li>\n",
      "</ol>\n",
      "<p>Assuming you all can manage accessing the internet on your own, let's focus on the latter two.</p>\n",
      "<h3>FTP client</h3>\n",
      "<p>An <strong>FTP client</strong> is software designed specifically for the purpose of sharing files between computers. There are widely-used, freely-available GUI applications (i.e., applications that use a graphic user interface, or the point-and-click, user-friendly software interfaces you are used to) that you can download for use, including <a href=\"https://filezilla-project.org/\">Filezilla</a> and <a href=\"https://cyberduck.io/\">Cyberduck</a>. You can also run an FTP client program through the command line on most computers, though the process varies by operating system.</p>\n",

      "<h2>Web hosting</h2>\n",
      "<p>You also need a server to transfer your files to, where they can be stored and shared on the Internet. This is what we call <strong>web hosting</strong> and there are multiple options here as well. The GCDI (CUNY Graduate Center Digital Initiatives) website contains a list of <a href=\"https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/digital-resource-guide/#cloud\">low-cost cloud hosting services for students</a>.

You will also be able to take publicly available text files and transform them into a corpus that you can perform your own analysis on. Finally, you will have some insight into the types of questions that can be addressed with text analysis.</p>\\n<h2>Cloning the repository</h2>\\n<p>Before getting started, clone <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/text-analysis\">this repository</a> to your local machine. Instructions for cloning Git repositories can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/blob/master/sections/cloning.md\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Setup and installation</h2>\\n<p>If you have not already installed the <a href=\"https://www.anaconda.com/download/\">Anaconda</a> distribution of Python 3, please do so.<br />\\nYou will also need <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/nltk.md\"><code>nltk</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/conda.md\"><code>matplotlib</code></a> to complete this tutorial. Both packages come installed with Anaconda. To check to be sure you have them, open a new Jupyter Notebook (or any IDE to run Python).<br />\\nFind Anaconda Navigator on your computer (it should be located in the folder with your other applications), and from Acadonda Navigator\\'s interface, launch a Jupyter Notebook.<br />\\n<img alt=\"jupyter\" src=\"images/jupyter.png\" /><br />\\nIt will open in the browser. All of the directories (folders) in your home directory will appear - we\\'ll get to that later. For now, select \\'New\\' &gt;&gt; Python3 in the upper right corner.<br />\\n<img alt=\"jupyter\" src=\"images/jupyter1.png\" /><br />\\nA blank page with an empty box should appear.<br />\\n<img alt=\"jupyter\" src=\"images/jupyter2.png\" /><br />\\nIn the box, type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">nltk</span>\\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">matplotlib</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>Press <strong>Shift</strong> + <strong>Enter</strong> to run the cell (or click run at the top of the page).

If you get an error message, either you have a typo or they are not installed. If it is the latter, open the command line and type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>conda install nltk -y\\nconda install matplotlib -y\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>Now we need to install the nltk corpus.

Please install all of the packages. If you are short on time, focus on book\" for this tutorial—you can download the other packages at another time for later use.<br />\\nYours will look a little different, but the same interface. Click on the \\'all\\' option and then \\'Download\\'. Once they all trun green, you can close the Downloader dialogue box.<br />\\n<img alt=\"nltk downloader\" src=\"images/nltk.png\" /><br />\\nReturn to your Jupyter Notebook and type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">nltk.book</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>A list of books should appear.

       " {'title': 'Text as Data',\n",
       "  'text': '<p>When we think of \"data,\" we often think of numbers, things that can be summarized, statisticized, and graphed. Rarely when I ask people \"what is data?\" do they respond \"<em>Moby Dick</em>.\" And yet, more and more, text is data. Whether it is <em>Moby Dick</em>, or every romance novel written since 1750, or today\\'s newspaper or twitter feed, we are able to transform written (and spoken) language into data that can be quantified and visualized.</p>\\n<h2>Corpora</h2>\\n<p>The first step in gathering insights from texts is to create a <strong>corpus</strong>. A corpus is a collection of texts that are somehow related to each other. For example, the <a href=\"https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/\">Corpus of Contemporary American English</a>, <a href=\"http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/\">Donald Trump\\'s Tweets</a>, <a href=\"https://byts.commons.gc.cuny.edu/\">text messages</a> sent by bilingual young adults, <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers/\">digitized newspapers</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/\">books</a> in the public domain are all corpora. There are infinitely many corpora, and, sometimes, you will want to make your own—that is, one that best fits your research question.<br />\\nThe route you take from here will depend on your research question. Let\\'s say, for example, that you want to examine gender differences in writing style. Based on previous linguistic research, you hypothesize that male-identified authors use more definitives than female-identified. So you collect two corpora—one written by men, one written by women—and you count the number of <em>the</em>s, <em>this</em>s, and <em>that</em>s compared to the number of <em>a</em>s, <em>an</em>s, and <em>one</em>s. Maybe you find a difference, maybe you don\\'t. We can already see that this is a relatively crude way of going about answering this question, but it is a start. (More likely, you\\'d use a <em>supervised classification task</em>, which you will learn about in the <a href=\"https://www.github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/machine-learning\">Machine Learning Tutorial</a>.)<br />\\nThere has been some research about how the <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/331/6014/176.full.pdf\">linguistic complexity of written language</a> in long-form pieces (i.e., books, articles, letters, etc.) has decreased over time. Simply put, people today use shorter sentences with fewer embedded clauses and complex tense constructions than people did in the past. (Note that this is not necessarily a bad or good thing.) Based on this research, we want to know if short-form platforms are emblematic of the change (we predict that they are based on our own experience with short-form platforms like email and Twitter). One way to do this would be to use Part-of-Speech tagging. Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a way to identify the category of words in a given text.<br />\\nFor example, the sentence:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I like the red bicycle.<br />\\nhas one pronoun, one verb, one determiner, one adjective, and one noun.<br />\\n(I : Pronoun), (like : Verb), (the : Determiner), (red : Adjective), (bicycle : Noun)<br />\\nNLTK uses the <a href=\"https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html\">Penn Tree Bank Tag Set</a>. This is a very detailed tag list that goes far beyond just nouns, verbs, and adjectives, but gives insight into different types of nouns, prepositions, and verbs as well. Virtually all POS taggers will create a list of (word, POS) pairs. If newspaper articles have a higher ratio of function words (prepositions, auxiliaries, determiners, etc.) to semantic words (nouns, verbs, adjectives), than tweets, then we have one piece of evidence supporting our hypothesis. It\\'s important to note here that we must use either ratios or otherwise normalized data (in the sense that raw numbers will not work). Because of the way that language works (function words are often repeated, for example), a sample of 100 words will have more unique words than a sample of 1,000. Therefore, to compare different data types (articles vs. tweets), this fact should be taken into account.</p>\\n</blockquote>',\n",

       " {'title': 'Cleaning and Normalizing',\n",
       "  'text': '<p>Generally, however, our questions are more about topics rather than writing style. So, once we have a corpus—whether that is one text or millions—we usually want to clean and normalize it. There are three terms we are going to need:<br />\\n- <strong>Text normalization</strong> is the process of taking a list of words and transforming it into a more uniform sequence. Usually, this involves removing punctuation, making the words all the same case, removing <em>stop words</em>, and either <em>stemming</em> or <em>lemmatizing</em> the words. It can also include expanding abbreviations or matching misspellings (but these are advanced practices that we will not cover).<br />\\nYou probably know what removing punctuation and capitalization refer to, but the other terms may be new:<br />\\n- <strong>Stop words</strong> are words that appear frequently in a language, often adding grammatical structure, but little semantic content. There is no official list of stop words for any language, though there are some common, all-purpose lists built in to NLTK. However, different tasks require different lists. The purpose of removing stop words is to remove words that are so common that their meaning is diminished across a large number of texts.<br />\\n- <strong>Stemming and lemmatizing</strong> both of these processes try to consolidate words like \"laughs\" and \"laughing\" to  \"laugh\" since they all mean essentially the same thing, they are just inflected differently. So again, in an attempt to reduce the number of words, and get a realistic understanding of the meaning of a text, these words are collapsed. Stemming does this by cutting off the end (very fast), lemmatizing does this by looking up the dictionary form (very slow).<br />\\nLanguage is messy, and created for and by people, not computers. There is a lot of grammatical information in a sentence that a computer cannot use. For example, I could say to you:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The house is burning.<br />\\nand you would understand me. You would also understand if I say<br />\\nhouse burn.<br />\\nThe first has more information about tense, and which house in particular, but the sentiment is the same either way.<br />\\nIn going from the first sentence to the normalized words, we removed the stop words (<em>the</em> and <em>is</em>), and removed punctuation and case, and lemmatized what was left (<em>burning</em> becomes <em>burn</em>—though we might have stemmed this, its impossible to tell from the example). This results in what is essentially a \"bag of words,\" or a corpus of words without any structure. Because normalizing your text reduces the number of words (and therefore the number of dimensions in your data), and keeps only the words that contribute meaning to the document, this cleaning is usually desirable.<br />\\nAgain, this will be covered more in depth in the Machine Learning Tutorial, but for the time being, we just need to know that there is \"clean\" and \"dirty\" versions of text data. Sometimes our questions are about the clean data, but sometimes our questions are in the \"dirt.\"</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Words into numbers</h2>\\n<p>In the next section, we are going to go through a series of methods that come built-in to NLTK that allow us to turn our words into numbers and visualizations.

Our text is behaving like a string. As discussed in the <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/python\">Python tutorial LINK</a>, Python does not <em>evaluate</em> strings, so it just counts the number of characters on either side. By default, this is 25 characters on either side of our target word (including spaces).<br />\\nIn the Jupyter Notebook, type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">concordance</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;whale&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>The output shows us the 25 characters on either side of the word \"whale\" in <em>Moby Dick</em>. Let\\'s try this with another word, \"love.\" Just replace the word \"whale\" with \"love,\" and we get the contexts in which Melville uses \"love\" in <em>Moby Dick</em>. <code>concordance</code> is used (behind the scenes) for several other functions, including <code>similar</code> and <code>common_contexts</code>.<br />\\nLet\\'s now see which words appear in similar contexts as the word \"love.\" NLTK has a built-in function for this as well: <code>similar</code>.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">similar</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;love&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>Behind the scenes, Python found all the contexts where the word \"love\" appears. It also finds similar environments, and then what words were common among the similar contexts. This gives a sense of what other words appear in similar contexts. This is somewhat interesting, but more interesting if we can compare it to something else. Let\\'s take a look at another text. What about <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>? Let\\'s see what words are similar to \"love\" in Jane Austen\\'s writing.

In chats, text messages, and other digital communication platforms, \"lol\" is exceedingly common.

Phatic language is language primarily for communicating social closeness. Phatic words stand in contrast to semantic words, which contribute meaning to the utterance.<br />\\nIf you are interested in this type of analysis, take a look at the <code>common_contexts</code> function in the <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/book/\">NLTK book</a> or in the <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/\">NLTK docs</a>.</p>',\n",

Another metric we can use is to visualize where the words appear in the text. In the case of <em>Moby Dick</em>, we want to compare where \"whale\" and \"monster\" appear throughout the text. In this case, the text is functioning as a list of words, and will make a mark where each word appears, offset from the first word. We will <em>pass</em> this <em>function</em> a <em>list</em> of <em>strings</em> to plot.

In this case (and all cases going forward), our text will be treated as a list of words. Therefore, we will use the <code>count</code> function. We could just as easily do this with a text editor, but performing this in Python allows us to save it to a variable and then utilize this statistic in other calculations (for example, if we want to know what percentage of words in a corpus are \\'lol\\', we would need a count of the \\'lol\\'s). In the next cell, type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">count</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;whale&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>We see that \"whale\" occurs 906 times, but that seems a little low. Let\\'s check on \"Whale\" and see how often that appears:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">count</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;Whale&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>\"Whale\" with a capital \"W\" appears 282 times. This is a problem for us—we actually want them to be collapsed into one word, since \"whale\" and \"Whale\" really are the same for our purposes. We will deal with that in a moment. For the time being, we will accept that we have two entries for \"whale.\"<br />\\nThis gets at a distinction between <strong>type</strong> and <strong>token</strong>. \"Whale\" and \"whale\" are different types (as of now) because they do not match identically. Every instance of \"whale\" in the corpus is another <strong>token</strong>—it is an instance of the type, \"whale.\" Therefore, there are 906 tokens of \"whale\" in our corpus.<br />\\nLet\\'s fix this by making all of the words lowercase. We will make a new list of words, and call it text1_tokens. We will fill this list with all the words in text1, but in their lowercase form. Python has a built-in function, <code>lower()</code> that takes all letters and makes them lowercase. In this same step, we are going to do a kind of tricky move, and only keep the words that are alphabetical and pass over anything that is punctuation or numbers. There is a built-in function, <code>isalpha()</code>, that will allow us to save only those words that are made of letters. If <code>isalpha()</code> is true, we\\'ll make the word lowercase, and keep the word. If not, we\\'ll pass over it and move to the next one.<br />\\nType the following code into a new cell in your notebook.

A list comprehension is a shorter, faster way to write a for-loop, but is syntactically a little more difficult to read (for a human).

Now <code>text1_tokens</code> is a list of all of the tokens in our corpus, with the punctuation removed, and all the words in lowercase.<br />\\nNow we want to know how many words there are in our corpus—that is, how many tokens in total. Therefore, we want to ask, \"What is the length of that list of words?\" Python has a built-in <code>len</code> function that allows you to find out the length of many types. Pass it a list, and it will tell you how many items are in the list. Pass it a string, and it will tell you how many characters are in the string. Pass it a dictionary, and it will tell you how many items are in the dictionary. In the next cell, type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>Just for comparison, check out how many words were in \"text1\"—before we removed the punctuation and the numbers.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>We see there are over 218,000 words in <em>Moby Dick</em> (including metadata). But this is the number of words total—we want to know the number of unique words. That is, we want to know how many <em>types</em>, not just how many tokens.<br />\\nIn order to get unique words, rather than just all words in general, we will make a <strong>set</strong> from the list. A <code>set</code> in Python work just like it would <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)\">in math</a>, it\\'s all the unique values, with any duplicate items removed.<br />\\nSo let\\'s find out the length of our set. just like in math, we can also nest our functions. So, rather than saying <code>x = set(text1_tokens)</code> and then finding the length of x, we can do it all in one step.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>Great! Now we can calculate the <strong>lexical density</strong> of <em>Moby Dick</em>. <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c2a8/56959d7f5880c98ccd4cfeb4b4f5b7133ec7.pdf\">Statistical studies</a> have shown that lexical density (the number of unique words per total words) is a good metric to approximate lexical diversity—the range of vocabulary an author uses. For our first pass at lexical density, we will simply divide the number of unique words by the total number of words:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>If we want to use this metric to compare texts, we immediately notice a problem. Lexical density is dependent upon the length of a text and therefore is strictly a comparative measure. It is possible to compare 100 words from one text to 100 words from another, but because language is finite and repetitive, it is not possible to compare 100 words from one to 200 words from another. Even with these restrictions, lexical density is a useful metric in grade level estimations, <a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/2226-471X/2/3/7\">vocabulary use</a> and genre classification, and a reasonable proxy for lexical diversity.<br />\\nLet\\'s take this constraint into account by working with only the first 10,000 words of our text. First we need to slice our list, returning the words in position 0 to position 9,999 (we\\'ll actually write it as \"up to, but not including\" 10,000).</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1_slice</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"mi\">10000</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>Now we can do the same calculation we did above:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_slice</span><span class=\"p\">))</span> <span class=\"o\">/</span> <span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_slice</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>This is a much higher number, though the number itself is arbitrary.

Remember, this variable, <code>text1_tokens</code>, contains a list of strings that we will work with. We want to remove the stop words from that list. The NLTK library comes with fairly comprehensive lists of stop words for many languages. Stop words are function words that contribute very little semantic meaning and most often have grammatical functions. Usually, these are function words such as determiners, prepositions, auxiliaries, and others.<br />\\nTo use NLTK\\'s stop words, we need to import the list of words from the corpus.

This means that we will strip off the grammatical structure from the words. For example, <code>cats —&gt; cat</code>, and <code>walked —&gt; walk</code>. If that was all we had to do, we could stem the corpus and achieve the correct result, because stemming (as the name implies) really just means cutting off affixes to find the root (or the stem). Very quickly, however, this gets complicated, such as in the case of <code>men —&gt; man</code> and <code>sang —&gt; sing</code>. Lemmatization deals with this by looking up the word in a reference and finding the appropriate root (though note that this still is not entirely accurate). Lemmatization, therefore, takes a relatively long time, since each word must be looked up in a reference. NLTK comes with pre-built stemmers and lemmatizers.<br />\\nWe will use the WordNet Lemmatizer from the NLTK Stem library, so let\\'s import that now:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">nltk.stem</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">WordNetLemmatizer</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>Because of the way that it is written \"under the hood,\" an instance of the lemmatizer needs to be called.

Try to remember how to calculate lexical density without looking back first. It is ok if you have forgotten.<br />\\nNow let\\'s have a look at the words Melville uses in <em>Moby Dick</em>. We\\'d like to look at all of the <em>types</em>, but not necessarily all of the <em>tokens.</em> We will order this set so that it is in an order we can handle. In the next cell, type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">sorted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_clean</span><span class=\"p\">))[:</span><span class=\"mi\">30</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p><code>Sorted</code> + <code>set</code> should give us a list of list of all the words in <em>Moby Dick</em> in alphabetical order, but we only want to see the first ones. Notice how there are some words we wouldn\\'t have expected, such as \\'abandon\\', \\'abandoned\\', \\'abandonedly\\', and \\'abandonment\\'. This process is far from perfect, but it is useful. However, depending on your goal, a different process, like <em>stemming</em> might be better. We will stick with the output of the Lemmatizer, but just for an illustration, we can try it out with a stemmer instead (Porter is the most common).  </p>\\n<h2>Stemming Words</h2>\\n<p>The code to implement this and view the output is below:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">nltk.stem</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">PorterStemmer</span>\\n<span class=\"n\">porter_stemmer</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">PorterStemmer</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">Let</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;s see what stemming does to words and compare it with lemmatizers:</span>\\n<span class=\"s1\">```python</span>\\n<span class=\"s1\">print(porter_stemmer.stem(&#39;</span><span class=\"n\">berry</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;))</span>\\n<span class=\"s1\">print(porter_stemmer.stem(&#39;</span><span class=\"n\">berry</span><span class=\"err\">&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\\n<span class=\"n\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">wordnet_lemmatizer</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lemmatize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"ss\">&quot;berry&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\\n<span class=\"n\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">wordnet_lemmatizer</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lemmatize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"ss\">&quot;berry&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>Stemmer doesn\\'t look so good, right?

How to choose between stemming and lemmatizing? As many things in text analysis, that depends. As a general rule, stemming is faster while lemmatizing is more accurate. For academics, usually the choice goes for the latter.<br />\\nAnyway, let\\'s stem our text:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">t1_porter</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span>\\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text1_clean</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\"n\">t_stemmed</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">porter_stemmer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">stem</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n    <span class=\"n\">t1_porter</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t_stemmed</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>Or, if we want a faster way:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">t1_porter</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">porter_stemmer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">stem</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>And let\\'s check the results:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t1_porter</span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">sorted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t1_porter</span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>A very different list of words is produced. This list is shorter than the list produced by the lemmatizer, but is also less accurate, and some of the words will completely change their meaning (like \\'berry\\' becoming \\'berri\\').<br />\\nNow that we\\'ve seen some of the differences between both, we will proceed using our lemmatized corpus, which we saved as \"text1_clean\":</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">my_dist</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">FreqDist</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_clean</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>If nothing happened, that is normal.

It doesn\\'t matter too much right now what it is, only that it worked. We can now plot this with the matplotlib function, <code>plot</code>. We want to plot the first 20 entries of the my_dist object.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">my_dist</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">plot</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>We\\'ve made a nice image here, but it might be easier to comprehend as a list. Because this is a special probability distribution object we can call the <code>most_common</code> on this, too. Let\\'s find the twenty most common words:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">my_dist</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">most_common</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>What about if we are interested in a list of specific words—perhaps to identify texts that have biblical references. Let\\'s make a (short) list of words that might suggest a biblical reference and see if they appear in <em>Moby Dick</em>. Set this list equal to a variable:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">b_words</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;god&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;apostle&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;angel&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>Then we will loop through the words in our cleaned corpus, and see if any of them are in our list of biblical words. We\\'ll then save into another list just those words that appear in both.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">my_list</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span>\\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">word</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">b_words</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">word</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text1_clean</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n        <span class=\"n\">my_list</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">word</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n    <span class=\"k\">else</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n        <span class=\"k\">pass</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>And then we will print the results.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">my_list</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>You can obviously do this with much larger lists and even compare entire novels if you wish, though it would take a while with this approach. You can use this to get similarity measures and answer related questions.</p>\\n<h1>Make Your Own Corpus</h1>\\n<p>Now that we have seen and implemented a series of text analysis techniques, let\\'s go to the Internet to find a new text. You could use something such as historic newspapers, or Supreme Court proceedings, or use any txt file on your computer. Here we will use <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org\">Project Gutenberg</a>. Project Gutenberg is an archive of public domain written works, available in a wide variety of formats, including .txt. You can download these to your computer or access them via the url. We\\'ll use the url method. We found <em>Don Quixote</em> in the archive, and will work with that.<br />\\nThe Python package, urllib, comes installed with Python, but is inactive by default, so we still need to import it to utilize the functions. Since we are only going to use the urlopen function, we will just import that one.<br />\\nIn the next cell, type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">urllib.request</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">urlopen</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>The <code>urlopen</code> function allows your program to interact with files on the internet by opening them. It does not read them, however—they are just available to be read in the next line. This is the default behavior any time a file is opened and read by Python. One reason is that you might want to read a file in different ways. For example, if you have a <strong>really</strong> big file—think big data—you might want to read line-by-line rather than the whole thing at once.<br />\\nNow let\\'s specify which URL we are going to use. Though you might be able to find <em>Don Quixote</em> in the Project Gutenberg files, please type this in so that we are all using the same format (there are multiple .txt files on the site, one with utf-8 encoding, another with ascii encoding). We want the utf-8 encoded one. The difference between these is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but you can check out this <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding\">introduction to character encoding</a> from The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) if you are interested.<br />\\nSet the URL we want to a variable:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">my_url</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/files/996/996-0.txt&quot;</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>We still need to open the file and read the file. You will have to do this with files stored locally as well. (in which case, you would type the path to the file (i.e., <code>data/texts/mytext.txt</code>) in place of <code>my_url</code>)</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">file</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">urlopen</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">my_url</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n<span class=\"n\">raw</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">file</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">read</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>This file is in bytes, so we need to decode it into a string. In the next cell, type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">don</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">raw</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">decode</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>Now let\\'s check on what kind of object we have in the \"don\" variable. Type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">type</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">don</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>This should be a string. Great! We have just read in our first file and now we are going to transform that string into a text that we can perform NLTK functions on. Since we already imported nltk at the beginning of our program, we don\\'t need to import it again, we can just use its functions by specifying <code>nltk</code> before the function. The first step is to tokenize the words, transforming the giant string into a list of words. A simple way to do this would be to split on spaces, and that would probably be fine, but we are going to use the NLTK tokenizer to ensure that edge cases are captured (i.e., \"don\\'t\" is made into 2 words: \"do\" and \"n\\'t\"). In the next cell, type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">don_tokens</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">nltk</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">word_tokenize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">don</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>You can check out the type of <code>don_tokens</code> using the <code>type()</code> function to make sure it worked—it should be a list. Let\\'s see how many words there are in our novel:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">don_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>Since this is a list, we can look at any slice of it that we want. Let\\'s inspect the first ten words:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">don_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">[:</span><span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>That looks like metadata—not what we want to analyze. We will strip this off before proceeding. If you were doing this to many texts, you would want to use <a href=\"https://regexone.com/\">Regular Expressions</a>. Regular Expressions are an extremely powerful way to match text in a document. However, we are just using this text, so we could either guess, or cut and paste the text into a text reader and identify the position of the first content (i.e., how many words in is the first word). That is the route we are going to take. We found that the content begins at word 315, so let\\'s make a slice of the text from word position 315 to the end.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">dq_text</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">don_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">315</span><span class=\"p\">:]</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>Finally, if we want to use the NLTK specific functions:<br />\\n- <code>concordance</code><br />\\n- <code>similar</code><br />\\n- <code>dispersion_plot</code><br />\\n- others from the <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/book/\">NLTK book</a><br />\\nwe would have to make a specific NLTK <code>Text</code> object.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">dq_nltk_text</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">nltk</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Text</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dq_text</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>If we wanted to use the built-in Python functions, we can just stick with our list of words in <code>dq_text</code>. Since we\\'ve already covered all of those functions, we are going to move ahead with cleaning our text.<br />\\nJust as we did earlier, we are going to remove the stopwords based on a list provided by NLTK, remove punctuation, and capitalization, and lemmatize the words. You can do it one by one as we did before, and that is totally fine. You can also merge some of the steps as you see below.<br />\\n1.

Instead, we will perform another type of analysis: part-of-speech (POS) tagging.</p>\\n<h1>Part-of-Speech Tagging</h1>\\n<p><em>Note that we are going to use the pre-cleaned, <code>dq_text</code> object for this section.</em><br />\\nPOS tagging is going through a text and identifying which part of speech each word belongs to (i.e., Noun, Verb, or Adjective). Every word belongs to a part of speech, but some words can be confusing.<br />\\n- Floyd is happy.<br />\\n- Happy is a state of being.<br />\\n- Happy has five letters.<br />\\n- I\\'m going to Happy Cat tonight.<br />\\nTherefore, part of speech is as much related to the word itself as its relationship to the words around it. A good part-of-speech tagger takes this into account, but there are some impossible cases as well:<br />\\n- Wanda was entertaining last night.<br />\\nPart of Speech tagging can be done very simply: with a very small <em>tag set</em>, or in a very complex way: with a much more elaborate tag set. We are going to implement a compromise, and use a neither small nor large tag set, the <a href=\"https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html\">Penn Tree Bank POS Tag Set</a>.<br />\\nThis is the tag set that is pre-loaded into NLTK. When we call the tagger, we expect it to return an object with the word and the tag associated. Because POS tagging is dependent upon the stop words, we have to use a text that includes the stop words. Therefore, we will go back to using the <code>dq_text</code> object for this section. Let\\'s try it out. Type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">dq_tagged</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">nltk</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">pos_tag</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dq_text</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>Let\\'s inspect what we have:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dq_tagged</span><span class=\"p\">[:</span><span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>This is a list of ordered tuples. (A tuple is like a list, but can\\'t be changed once it is created.) Each element in the list is a pairing of <code>(word, POS-tag)</code>. (Tuples are denoted with parentheses, rather than square brackets.) This is great, but it is very detailed. I would like to know how many Nouns, Verbs, and Adjectives I have. <br />\\nFirst, I\\'ll make an empty dictionary to hold my results. Then I will go through this list of tuples and count the number of times each tag appears. Every time I encounter a new tag, I\\'ll add it to a dictionary and then increment by one every time I encounter that tag again. Let\\'s see what that looks like in code:<br />\\n```python<br />\\ntag_dict = {}</p>',\n",
       "  'challenge': None,\n",
       "  'solution': None},\n",
       " {'title': 'For every word/tag pair in my list,',\n",
       "  'text': '<p>for (word, tag) in dq_tagged:<br />\\n    if tag in tag_dict:<br />\\n        tag_dict[tag]+=1<br />\\n    else:<br />\\n        tag_dict[tag] = 1</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">Now</span> <span class=\"n\">let</span><span class=\"err\">&#39;</span><span class=\"n\">s</span> <span class=\"n\">see</span> <span class=\"n\">what</span> <span class=\"n\">we</span> <span class=\"n\">got</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n<span class=\"o\">```</span><span class=\"n\">python</span>\\n<span class=\"n\">tag_dict</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>This would be better with some order to it, but dictionaries are made to be unordered. When we google \"sort dictionaries python\" we find a solution in our great friend <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/613218\">stack overflow</a>. Even though we cannot sort a dictionary, we can get a representation of a dictionary that is sorted. Let\\'s do it and find out what the most common tag is.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">tag_dict_sorted</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">sorted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">tag_dict</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">items</span><span class=\"p\">(),</span>\\n             <span class=\"n\">reverse</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">True</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\\n             <span class=\"n\">key</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">lambda</span> <span class=\"n\">kv</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">kv</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">tag_dict_sorted</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>Now check out what we have. It looks like NN is the most common tag. We can look up what NN means in the <a href=\"https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html\">Penn Tree Bank</a>. Looks like NN is a Noun, singular or mass. Great! This information will likely help us with genre classification, or identifying the author of a text, or a variety of other functions.</p>\\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\\n<p>At this point, you should have a familiarity with what is possible with text analysis, and some of the most important functions (i.e., cleaning and part-of-speech tagging).

By completing this tutorial, you will have a general sense of how to turn text into data using the Python package, NLTK. You will also be able to take publicly available text files and transform them into a corpus that you can perform your own analysis on. Finally, you will have some insight into the types of questions that can be addressed with text analysis.</p>\\n<h2>Cloning the repository</h2>\\n<p>Before getting started, clone <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/text-analysis\">this repository</a> to your local machine. Instructions for cloning Git repositories can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/blob/master/sections/cloning.md\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Setup and installation</h2>\\n<p>If you have not already installed the <a href=\"https://www.anaconda.com/download/\">Anaconda</a> distribution of Python 3, please do so.</p>\\n<p>You will also need <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/nltk.md\"><code>nltk</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/conda.md\"><code>matplotlib</code></a> to complete this tutorial. Both packages come installed with Anaconda. To check to be sure you have them, open a new Jupyter Notebook (or any IDE to run Python).</p>\\n<p>Find Anaconda Navigator on your computer (it should be located in the folder with your other applications), and from Acadonda Navigator\\'s interface, launch a Jupyter Notebook.</p>\\n<p><img alt=\"jupyter\" src=\"images/jupyter.png\" /></p>\\n<p>It will open in the browser. All of the directories (folders) in your home directory will appear - we\\'ll get to that later. For now, select \\'New\\' &gt;&gt; Python3 in the upper right corner.</p>\\n<p><img alt=\"jupyter\" src=\"images/jupyter1.png\" /></p>\\n<p>A blank page with an empty box should appear.</p>\\n<p><img alt=\"jupyter\" src=\"images/jupyter2.png\" /></p>\\n<p>In the box, type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">nltk</span>\\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">matplotlib</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>Press <strong>Shift</strong> + <strong>Enter</strong> to run the cell (or click run at the top of the page). Don\\'t worry too much about what this is doing - that will be explained later in this tutorial. For now, we just want to make sure the packages we will need are installed.</p>\\n<p><img alt=\"jupyter\" src=\"images/jupyter3.png\" /></p>\\n<p>If nothing happens, they are installed and you are ready to move on! If you get an error message, either you have a typo or they are not installed. If it is the latter, open the command line and type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>conda install nltk -y\\nconda install matplotlib -y\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>Now we need to install the nltk corpus. This is very large and may take some time if you are on a weak connection.</p>\\n<p>In the next cell, type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">nltk</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">download</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>and run the cell.</p>\\n<p>The NLTK downloader should appear. Please install all of the packages. If you are short on time, focus on book\" for this tutorial—you can download the other packages at another time for later use.</p>\\n<p>Yours will look a little different, but the same interface. Click on the \\'all\\' option and then \\'Download\\'. Once they all trun green, you can close the Downloader dialogue box.</p>\\n<p><img alt=\"nltk downloader\" src=\"images/nltk.png\" /></p>\\n<p>Return to your Jupyter Notebook and type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">nltk.book</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>A list of books should appear.

       "               '<p>When we think of \"data,\" we often think of numbers, things that can be summarized, statisticized, and graphed. Rarely when I ask people \"what is data?\" do they respond \"<em>Moby Dick</em>.\" And yet, more and more, text is data. Whether it is <em>Moby Dick</em>, or every romance novel written since 1750, or today\\'s newspaper or twitter feed, we are able to transform written (and spoken) language into data that can be quantified and visualized.</p>\\n<h2>Corpora</h2>\\n<p>The first step in gathering insights from texts is to create a <strong>corpus</strong>. A corpus is a collection of texts that are somehow related to each other. For example, the <a href=\"https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/\">Corpus of Contemporary American English</a>, <a href=\"http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/\">Donald Trump\\'s Tweets</a>, <a href=\"https://byts.commons.gc.cuny.edu/\">text messages</a> sent by bilingual young adults, <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers/\">digitized newspapers</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/\">books</a> in the public domain are all corpora. There are infinitely many corpora, and, sometimes, you will want to make your own—that is, one that best fits your research question.</p>\\n<p>The route you take from here will depend on your research question. Let\\'s say, for example, that you want to examine gender differences in writing style. Based on previous linguistic research, you hypothesize that male-identified authors use more definitives than female-identified. So you collect two corpora—one written by men, one written by women—and you count the number of <em>the</em>s, <em>this</em>s, and <em>that</em>s compared to the number of <em>a</em>s, <em>an</em>s, and <em>one</em>s. Maybe you find a difference, maybe you don\\'t. We can already see that this is a relatively crude way of going about answering this question, but it is a start. (More likely, you\\'d use a <em>supervised classification task</em>, which you will learn about in the <a href=\"https://www.github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/machine-learning\">Machine Learning Tutorial</a>.)</p>\\n<p>There has been some research about how the <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/331/6014/176.full.pdf\">linguistic complexity of written language</a> in long-form pieces (i.e., books, articles, letters, etc.) has decreased over time. Simply put, people today use shorter sentences with fewer embedded clauses and complex tense constructions than people did in the past. (Note that this is not necessarily a bad or good thing.) Based on this research, we want to know if short-form platforms are emblematic of the change (we predict that they are based on our own experience with short-form platforms like email and Twitter). One way to do this would be to use Part-of-Speech tagging. Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a way to identify the category of words in a given text.</p>\\n<p>For example, the sentence:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I like the red bicycle.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>has one pronoun, one verb, one determiner, one adjective, and one noun.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>(I : Pronoun), (like : Verb), (the : Determiner), (red : Adjective), (bicycle : Noun)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>NLTK uses the <a href=\"https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html\">Penn Tree Bank Tag Set</a>. This is a very detailed tag list that goes far beyond just nouns, verbs, and adjectives, but gives insight into different types of nouns, prepositions, and verbs as well. Virtually all POS taggers will create a list of (word, POS) pairs. If newspaper articles have a higher ratio of function words (prepositions, auxiliaries, determiners, etc.) to semantic words (nouns, verbs, adjectives), than tweets, then we have one piece of evidence supporting our hypothesis. It\\'s important to note here that we must use either ratios or otherwise normalized data (in the sense that raw numbers will not work). Because of the way that language works (function words are often repeated, for example), a sample of 100 words will have more unique words than a sample of 1,000. Therefore, to compare different data types (articles vs. tweets), this fact should be taken into account.</p>\\n')]),\n",

       "               '<p>Generally, however, our questions are more about topics rather than writing style. So, once we have a corpus—whether that is one text or millions—we usually want to clean and normalize it. There are three terms we are going to need:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Text normalization</strong> is the process of taking a list of words and transforming it into a more uniform sequence. Usually, this involves removing punctuation, making the words all the same case, removing <em>stop words</em>, and either <em>stemming</em> or <em>lemmatizing</em> the words. It can also include expanding abbreviations or matching misspellings (but these are advanced practices that we will not cover).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>You probably know what removing punctuation and capitalization refer to, but the other terms may be new:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Stop words</strong> are words that appear frequently in a language, often adding grammatical structure, but little semantic content. There is no official list of stop words for any language, though there are some common, all-purpose lists built in to NLTK. However, different tasks require different lists. The purpose of removing stop words is to remove words that are so common that their meaning is diminished across a large number of texts.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Stemming and lemmatizing</strong> both of these processes try to consolidate words like \"laughs\" and \"laughing\" to  \"laugh\" since they all mean essentially the same thing, they are just inflected differently. So again, in an attempt to reduce the number of words, and get a realistic understanding of the meaning of a text, these words are collapsed. Stemming does this by cutting off the end (very fast), lemmatizing does this by looking up the dictionary form (very slow).</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Language is messy, and created for and by people, not computers. There is a lot of grammatical information in a sentence that a computer cannot use. For example, I could say to you:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The house is burning.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>and you would understand me. You would also understand if I say</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>house burn.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The first has more information about tense, and which house in particular, but the sentiment is the same either way.</p>\\n<p>In going from the first sentence to the normalized words, we removed the stop words (<em>the</em> and <em>is</em>), and removed punctuation and case, and lemmatized what was left (<em>burning</em> becomes <em>burn</em>—though we might have stemmed this, its impossible to tell from the example). This results in what is essentially a \"bag of words,\" or a corpus of words without any structure. Because normalizing your text reduces the number of words (and therefore the number of dimensions in your data), and keeps only the words that contribute meaning to the document, this cleaning is usually desirable.</p>\\n<p>Again, this will be covered more in depth in the Machine Learning Tutorial, but for the time being, we just need to know that there is \"clean\" and \"dirty\" versions of text data. Sometimes our questions are about the clean data, but sometimes our questions are in the \"dirt.\"</p>\\n<h2>Words into numbers</h2>\\n<p>In the next section, we are going to go through a series of methods that come built-in to NLTK that allow us to turn our words into numbers and visualizations. This is just scratching the surface, but should give you an idea of what is possible beyond just counting words.</p>\\n')]),\n",

In the middle of this tutorial, we are going to make a dispersion plot of words in our texts.</p>\\n<p>Finally, because of a quirk of Jupyter notebooks, we need to specify that matplotlib should display its graphs in the notebook (as opposed to in a separate window), so we type this command (this is technically a Jupyter command, not Python):</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">%</span><span class=\"n\">matplotlib</span> <span class=\"n\">inline</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>All three of these commands can be written in the same cell and run all at once (<code>Shift + Enter</code>) or in different cells.</p>\\n<p><img alt=\"Image showing that the three lines given above should be written in a single cell in the Jupyter notebook, one after another\" src=\"images/imports.png\" /></p>\\n<p>If you don\\'t see an error when you run the notebook—that is, if nothing happens—you can move on to the next step.</p>\\n<p>Next, we need to load all of the NLTK corpora into our program. Even though we downloaded them to our computer, we need to tell Python we want to use them.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">nltk.book</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>The pre-loaded NLTK texts should appear again. These are preformatted data sets. We will still have to do some minor processing, but having the data in this format saves us a few steps. At the end of this tutorial, we will make our own corpus. This is a special type of python object specific to NLTK (it isn\\'t a string, list, or dictionary). Sometimes it will behave like a string, and sometimes like a list of words. How it is behaving is noted for each function as we try it out.</p>\\n<p><img alt=\"Image showing a second cell with the &quot;from nltk.book import *&quot; line and another line defining some text data\" src=\"images/nltkbook.png\" /></p>\\n<p>Let\\'s start by analyzing <em>Moby Dick</em>, which is <code>text1</code> for NLTK.</p>\\n')]),\n",

Our text is behaving like a string. As discussed in the <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/python\">Python tutorial LINK</a>, Python does not <em>evaluate</em> strings, so it just counts the number of characters on either side. By default, this is 25 characters on either side of our target word (including spaces).</p>\\n<p>In the Jupyter Notebook, type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">concordance</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;whale&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>The output shows us the 25 characters on either side of the word \"whale\" in <em>Moby Dick</em>. Let\\'s try this with another word, \"love.\" Just replace the word \"whale\" with \"love,\" and we get the contexts in which Melville uses \"love\" in <em>Moby Dick</em>. <code>concordance</code> is used (behind the scenes) for several other functions, including <code>similar</code> and <code>common_contexts</code>.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s now see which words appear in similar contexts as the word \"love.\" NLTK has a built-in function for this as well: <code>similar</code>.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">similar</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;love&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>Behind the scenes, Python found all the contexts where the word \"love\" appears. It also finds similar environments, and then what words were common among the similar contexts. This gives a sense of what other words appear in similar contexts. This is somewhat interesting, but more interesting if we can compare it to something else. Let\\'s take a look at another text. What about <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>? Let\\'s see what words are similar to \"love\" in Jane Austen\\'s writing. In the next cell, type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text2</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">similar</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;love&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>We can compare the two and see immediately that Melville and Austen use the word \"love\" differently.</p>\\n<h2>Investigating \"lol\"</h2>\\n<p>Let\\'s expand from novels for a minute and take a look at the NLTK Chat Corpus. In chats, text messages, and other digital communication platforms, \"lol\" is exceedingly common. We know it doesn\\'t simply mean \"laughing out loud\"—maybe the <code>similar</code> function can provide some insight into what it does mean.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text5</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">similar</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;lol&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>The resulting list is a lot of greetings, indicating that \"lol\" probably has more of a <a href=\"http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100321840\">phatic function</a>. Phatic language is language primarily for communicating social closeness. Phatic words stand in contrast to semantic words, which contribute meaning to the utterance.</p>\\n<p>If you are interested in this type of analysis, take a look at the <code>common_contexts</code> function in the <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/book/\">NLTK book</a> or in the <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/\">NLTK docs</a>.</p>\\n')]),\n",

Another metric we can use is to visualize where the words appear in the text. In the case of <em>Moby Dick</em>, we want to compare where \"whale\" and \"monster\" appear throughout the text. In this case, the text is functioning as a list of words, and will make a mark where each word appears, offset from the first word. We will <em>pass</em> this <em>function</em> a <em>list</em> of <em>strings</em> to plot. This will likely help us develop a visual of the story - where the whale goes from being a whale to being a monster to being a whale again.

If we did not know the story, this could give us a picture of the narrative arc.</p>\\n<p>Try this with <code>text2</code>, <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>. Some relevant words are \"marriage,\" \"love,\" \"home,\" \"mother,\" \"husband,\" \"sister,\" and \"wife.\" Pick a few to compare. You can compare an unlimited number, but it\\'s easier to read a few at a time.

In this case (and all cases going forward), our text will be treated as a list of words. Therefore, we will use the <code>count</code> function. We could just as easily do this with a text editor, but performing this in Python allows us to save it to a variable and then utilize this statistic in other calculations (for example, if we want to know what percentage of words in a corpus are \\'lol\\', we would need a count of the \\'lol\\'s). In the next cell, type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">count</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;whale&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>We see that \"whale\" occurs 906 times, but that seems a little low. Let\\'s check on \"Whale\" and see how often that appears:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">count</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;Whale&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>\"Whale\" with a capital \"W\" appears 282 times. This is a problem for us—we actually want them to be collapsed into one word, since \"whale\" and \"Whale\" really are the same for our purposes. We will deal with that in a moment. For the time being, we will accept that we have two entries for \"whale.\"</p>\\n<p>This gets at a distinction between <strong>type</strong> and <strong>token</strong>. \"Whale\" and \"whale\" are different types (as of now) because they do not match identically. Every instance of \"whale\" in the corpus is another <strong>token</strong>—it is an instance of the type, \"whale.\" Therefore, there are 906 tokens of \"whale\" in our corpus.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s fix this by making all of the words lowercase. We will make a new list of words, and call it text1_tokens. We will fill this list with all the words in text1, but in their lowercase form. Python has a built-in function, <code>lower()</code> that takes all letters and makes them lowercase. In this same step, we are going to do a kind of tricky move, and only keep the words that are alphabetical and pass over anything that is punctuation or numbers. There is a built-in function, <code>isalpha()</code>, that will allow us to save only those words that are made of letters. If <code>isalpha()</code> is true, we\\'ll make the word lowercase, and keep the word. If not, we\\'ll pass over it and move to the next one.</p>\\n<p>Type the following code into a new cell in your notebook. Pay special attention to the indentation, which must appear as below.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span>\\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n  <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isalpha</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\\n    <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lower</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\\n    <span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p><img alt=\"code\" src=\"images/for_loop_tokens.png\" /></p>\\n<p>Another way to perform the same action more tersely is to use what\\'s called a <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions\">list comprehension</a>. A list comprehension is a shorter, faster way to write a for-loop, but is syntactically a little more difficult to read (for a human). But, in this case, it\\'s much faster to process:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lower</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text1</span> <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isalpha</span><span class=\"p\">()]</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>Great! Now <code>text1_tokens</code> is a list of all of the tokens in our corpus, with the punctuation removed, and all the words in lowercase.</p>\\n<p>Now we want to know how many words there are in our corpus—that is, how many tokens in total. Therefore, we want to ask, \"What is the length of that list of words?\" Python has a built-in <code>len</code> function that allows you to find out the length of many types. Pass it a list, and it will tell you how many items are in the list. Pass it a string, and it will tell you how many characters are in the string. Pass it a dictionary, and it will tell you how many items are in the dictionary. In the next cell, type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>Just for comparison, check out how many words were in \"text1\"—before we removed the punctuation and the numbers.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>We see there are over 218,000 words in <em>Moby Dick</em> (including metadata). But this is the number of words total—we want to know the number of unique words. That is, we want to know how many <em>types</em>, not just how many tokens.</p>\\n<p>In order to get unique words, rather than just all words in general, we will make a <strong>set</strong> from the list. A <code>set</code> in Python work just like it would <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)\">in math</a>, it\\'s all the unique values, with any duplicate items removed.</p>\\n<p>So let\\'s find out the length of our set. just like in math, we can also nest our functions. So, rather than saying <code>x = set(text1_tokens)</code> and then finding the length of x, we can do it all in one step.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>Great! Now we can calculate the <strong>lexical density</strong> of <em>Moby Dick</em>. <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c2a8/56959d7f5880c98ccd4cfeb4b4f5b7133ec7.pdf\">Statistical studies</a> have shown that lexical density (the number of unique words per total words) is a good metric to approximate lexical diversity—the range of vocabulary an author uses. For our first pass at lexical density, we will simply divide the number of unique words by the total number of words:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>If we want to use this metric to compare texts, we immediately notice a problem. Lexical density is dependent upon the length of a text and therefore is strictly a comparative measure. It is possible to compare 100 words from one text to 100 words from another, but because language is finite and repetitive, it is not possible to compare 100 words from one to 200 words from another. Even with these restrictions, lexical density is a useful metric in grade level estimations, <a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/2226-471X/2/3/7\">vocabulary use</a> and genre classification, and a reasonable proxy for lexical diversity.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s take this constraint into account by working with only the first 10,000 words of our text. First we need to slice our list, returning the words in position 0 to position 9,999 (we\\'ll actually write it as \"up to, but not including\" 10,000).</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">text1_slice</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"mi\">10000</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>Now we can do the same calculation we did above:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_slice</span><span class=\"p\">))</span> <span class=\"o\">/</span> <span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_slice</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>This is a much higher number, though the number itself is arbitrary. When comparing different texts, this step is essential to get an accurate measure.</p>\\n<h2>Challenge</h2>\\n<p>Let\\'s compare the lexical density of <em>Moby Dick</em> with <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>. Make sure to:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Make all the words lowercase and remove punctuation.</li>\\n<li>Make a slice of the first 10,000 words.</li>\\n<li>Calculate lexical density by dividing the length of the set of the slice by the length of the slice.</li>\\n</ol>\\n')]),\n",

For the most part, we want to exclude these features since they don\\'t actually contribute very much semantic content to our models. Therefore, we will:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Remove capitalization and punctuation (we\\'ve already done this).</li>\\n<li>Remove stop words.</li>\\n<li>Lemmatize (or stem) our words, i.e. \"jumping\" and \"jumps\" become \"jump.\"</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2>Removing Stopwords</h2>\\n<p>We already completed step one, and are now working with our <code>text1_tokens</code>. Remember, this variable, <code>text1_tokens</code>, contains a list of strings that we will work with. We want to remove the stop words from that list. The NLTK library comes with fairly comprehensive lists of stop words for many languages. Stop words are function words that contribute very little semantic meaning and most often have grammatical functions. Usually, these are function words such as determiners, prepositions, auxiliaries, and others.</p>\\n<p>To use NLTK\\'s stop words, we need to import the list of words from the corpus. (We could have done this at the beginning of our program, and in more fully developed code, we would put it up there, but this works, too.)

We will do this by making a set of words. Sets are the same in Python as they are in math, they are all of the unique words rather than all the words.

This means that we will strip off the grammatical structure from the words. For example, <code>cats —&gt; cat</code>, and <code>walked —&gt; walk</code>. If that was all we had to do, we could stem the corpus and achieve the correct result, because stemming (as the name implies) really just means cutting off affixes to find the root (or the stem). Very quickly, however, this gets complicated, such as in the case of <code>men —&gt; man</code> and <code>sang —&gt; sing</code>. Lemmatization deals with this by looking up the word in a reference and finding the appropriate root (though note that this still is not entirely accurate). Lemmatization, therefore, takes a relatively long time, since each word must be looked up in a reference. NLTK comes with pre-built stemmers and lemmatizers.</p>\\n<p>We will use the WordNet Lemmatizer from the NLTK Stem library, so let\\'s import that now:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">nltk.stem</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">WordNetLemmatizer</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>Because of the way that it is written \"under the hood,\" an instance of the lemmatizer needs to be called.

Try to remember how to calculate lexical density without looking back first. It is ok if you have forgotten.</p>\\n<p>Now let\\'s have a look at the words Melville uses in <em>Moby Dick</em>. We\\'d like to look at all of the <em>types</em>, but not necessarily all of the <em>tokens.</em> We will order this set so that it is in an order we can handle.

Notice how there are some words we wouldn\\'t have expected, such as \\'abandon\\', \\'abandoned\\', \\'abandonedly\\', and \\'abandonment\\'. This process is far from perfect, but it is useful. However, depending on your goal, a different process, like <em>stemming</em> might be better. We will stick with the output of the Lemmatizer, but just for an illustration, we can try it out with a stemmer instead (Porter is the most common).  </p>\\n<h2>Stemming Words</h2>\\n<p>The code to implement this and view the output is below:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">nltk.stem</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">PorterStemmer</span>\\n<span class=\"n\">porter_stemmer</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">PorterStemmer</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">Let</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;s see what stemming does to words and compare it with lemmatizers:</span>\\n<span class=\"s1\">```python</span>\\n<span class=\"s1\">print(porter_stemmer.stem(&#39;</span><span class=\"n\">berry</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;))</span>\\n<span class=\"s1\">print(porter_stemmer.stem(&#39;</span><span class=\"n\">berry</span><span class=\"err\">&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\\n<span class=\"n\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">wordnet_lemmatizer</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lemmatize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"ss\">&quot;berry&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\\n<span class=\"n\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">wordnet_lemmatizer</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">lemmatize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"ss\">&quot;berry&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>Stemmer doesn\\'t look so good, right?

How to choose between stemming and lemmatizing? As many things in text analysis, that depends. As a general rule, stemming is faster while lemmatizing is more accurate. For academics, usually the choice goes for the latter.</p>\\n<p>Anyway, let\\'s stem our text:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">t1_porter</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span>\\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text1_clean</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\"n\">t_stemmed</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">porter_stemmer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">stem</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n    <span class=\"n\">t1_porter</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t_stemmed</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>Or, if we want a faster way:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">t1_porter</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">porter_stemmer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">stem</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text1_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>And let\\'s check the results:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t1_porter</span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">sorted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t1_porter</span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>A very different list of words is produced. This list is shorter than the list produced by the lemmatizer, but is also less accurate, and some of the words will completely change their meaning (like \\'berry\\' becoming \\'berri\\').</p>\\n<p>Now that we\\'ve seen some of the differences between both, we will proceed using our lemmatized corpus, which we saved as \"text1_clean\":</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">my_dist</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">FreqDist</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text1_clean</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>If nothing happened, that is normal.

Let\\'s make a (short) list of words that might suggest a biblical reference and see if they appear in <em>Moby Dick</em>. Set this list equal to a variable:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">b_words</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;god&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;apostle&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;angel&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>Then we will loop through the words in our cleaned corpus, and see if any of them are in our list of biblical words.

       "               '<p>Now that we have seen and implemented a series of text analysis techniques, let\\'s go to the Internet to find a new text. You could use something such as historic newspapers, or Supreme Court proceedings, or use any txt file on your computer. Here we will use <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org\">Project Gutenberg</a>. Project Gutenberg is an archive of public domain written works, available in a wide variety of formats, including .txt. You can download these to your computer or access them via the url. We\\'ll use the url method. We found <em>Don Quixote</em> in the archive, and will work with that.</p>\\n<p>The Python package, urllib, comes installed with Python, but is inactive by default, so we still need to import it to utilize the functions. Since we are only going to use the urlopen function, we will just import that one.</p>\\n<p>In the next cell, type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">urllib.request</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">urlopen</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>The <code>urlopen</code> function allows your program to interact with files on the internet by opening them. It does not read them, however—they are just available to be read in the next line. This is the default behavior any time a file is opened and read by Python. One reason is that you might want to read a file in different ways. For example, if you have a <strong>really</strong> big file—think big data—you might want to read line-by-line rather than the whole thing at once.</p>\\n<p>Now let\\'s specify which URL we are going to use. Though you might be able to find <em>Don Quixote</em> in the Project Gutenberg files, please type this in so that we are all using the same format (there are multiple .txt files on the site, one with utf-8 encoding, another with ascii encoding). We want the utf-8 encoded one. The difference between these is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but you can check out this <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding\">introduction to character encoding</a> from The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) if you are interested.</p>\\n<p>Set the URL we want to a variable:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">my_url</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/files/996/996-0.txt&quot;</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>We still need to open the file and read the file. You will have to do this with files stored locally as well. (in which case, you would type the path to the file (i.e., <code>data/texts/mytext.txt</code>) in place of <code>my_url</code>)</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">file</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">urlopen</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">my_url</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n<span class=\"n\">raw</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">file</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">read</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>This file is in bytes, so we need to decode it into a string.

Type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">type</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">don</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>This should be a string. Great! We have just read in our first file and now we are going to transform that string into a text that we can perform NLTK functions on. Since we already imported nltk at the beginning of our program, we don\\'t need to import it again, we can just use its functions by specifying <code>nltk</code> before the function. The first step is to tokenize the words, transforming the giant string into a list of words. A simple way to do this would be to split on spaces, and that would probably be fine, but we are going to use the NLTK tokenizer to ensure that edge cases are captured (i.e., \"don\\'t\" is made into 2 words: \"do\" and \"n\\'t\"). In the next cell, type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">don_tokens</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">nltk</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">word_tokenize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">don</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>You can check out the type of <code>don_tokens</code> using the <code>type()</code> function to make sure it worked—it should be a list. Let\\'s see how many words there are in our novel:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">don_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>Since this is a list, we can look at any slice of it that we want.

We will strip this off before proceeding. If you were doing this to many texts, you would want to use <a href=\"https://regexone.com/\">Regular Expressions</a>. Regular Expressions are an extremely powerful way to match text in a document. However, we are just using this text, so we could either guess, or cut and paste the text into a text reader and identify the position of the first content (i.e., how many words in is the first word). That is the route we are going to take. We found that the content begins at word 315, so let\\'s make a slice of the text from word position 315 to the end.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">dq_text</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">don_tokens</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">315</span><span class=\"p\">:]</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>Finally, if we want to use the NLTK specific functions:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>concordance</code></li>\\n<li><code>similar</code></li>\\n<li><code>dispersion_plot</code></li>\\n<li>others from the <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/book/\">NLTK book</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>we would have to make a specific NLTK <code>Text</code> object.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">dq_nltk_text</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">nltk</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Text</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dq_text</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>If we wanted to use the built-in Python functions, we can just stick with our list of words in <code>dq_text</code>.

A good part-of-speech tagger takes this into account, but there are some impossible cases as well:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Wanda was entertaining last night.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Part of Speech tagging can be done very simply: with a very small <em>tag set</em>, or in a very complex way: with a much more elaborate tag set. We are going to implement a compromise, and use a neither small nor large tag set, the <a href=\"https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html\">Penn Tree Bank POS Tag Set</a>.</p>\\n<p>This is the tag set that is pre-loaded into NLTK. When we call the tagger, we expect it to return an object with the word and the tag associated. Because POS tagging is dependent upon the stop words, we have to use a text that includes the stop words. Therefore, we will go back to using the <code>dq_text</code> object for this section. Let\\'s try it out. Type:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">dq_tagged</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">nltk</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">pos_tag</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dq_text</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>Let\\'s inspect what we have:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dq_tagged</span><span class=\"p\">[:</span><span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>This is a list of ordered tuples. (A tuple is like a list, but can\\'t be changed once it is created.) Each element in the list is a pairing of <code>(word, POS-tag)</code>. (Tuples are denoted with parentheses, rather than square brackets.) This is great, but it is very detailed. I would like to know how many Nouns, Verbs, and Adjectives I have. </p>\\n<p>First, I\\'ll make an empty dictionary to hold my results. Then I will go through this list of tuples and count the number of times each tag appears. Every time I encounter a new tag, I\\'ll add it to a dictionary and then increment by one every time I encounter that tag again. Let\\'s see what that looks like in code:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">tag_dict</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">{}</span>\\n<span class=\"c1\"># For every word/tag pair in my list,</span>\\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">word</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">tag</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">dq_tagged</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">tag</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">tag_dict</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n        <span class=\"n\">tag_dict</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">tag</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"o\">+=</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span>\\n    <span class=\"k\">else</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n        <span class=\"n\">tag_dict</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">tag</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>Now let\\'s see what we got:</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">tag_dict</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>This would be better with some order to it, but dictionaries are made to be unordered. When we google \"sort dictionaries python\" we find a solution in our great friend <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/613218\">stack overflow</a>. Even though we cannot sort a dictionary, we can get a representation of a dictionary that is sorted. Let\\'s do it and find out what the most common tag is.</p>\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">tag_dict_sorted</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">sorted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">tag_dict</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">items</span><span class=\"p\">(),</span>\\n             <span class=\"n\">reverse</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">True</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\\n             <span class=\"n\">key</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">lambda</span> <span class=\"n\">kv</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">kv</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">tag_dict_sorted</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n<p>Now check out what we have. It looks like NN is the most common tag. We can look up what NN means in the <a href=\"https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html\">Penn Tree Bank</a>. Looks like NN is a Noun, singular or mass. Great! This information will likely help us with genre classification, or identifying the author of a text, or a variety of other functions.</p>\\n')]),\n",
