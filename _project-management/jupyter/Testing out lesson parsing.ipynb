      "<h1>What are Git, GitHub and Markdown?</h1>\n",
      "<h2>What is Git?</h2>\n",
      "<p><strong>Git</strong> is software used for version control—that is, tracking the state of files and changes you make to them over time. Git can be enabled in a folder, and then used to save the state of the contents in that folder at different points in the future, as designated by you. In the language of Git, a folder is called a <em>repository</em>. In the context of this workshop, it refers to a folder that is being tracked by Git. Using Git, you can view a log of the changes you've made to the files in a repository and compare changes over time. You can also revert back to previous versions, and create branches of a project to explore different futures. Git is also useful for collaboration, as a repository can be shared across computers, and its contents can be asynchonously developed and eventually merged with the main project. </p>\n",
      "<h2>What is GitHub?</h2>\n",
      "<p><strong>GitHub</strong> is a online platform for hosting Git repositories. It functions for some, predominantly programmers, as a social network for sharing and collaborating on code-based projects. Users can share their own projects, as well as search for others, which they can then often work on and contribute to. Digital Humanists, librarians, and other academics are also finding ways Git and GitHub are useful in writing projects and teaching. GitHub also serves as a web-hosting platform, allowing users to create websites from their repositories.</p>\n",
      "<h2>What is Markdown?</h2>\n",
      "<p>Markdown is a markup language for formatting text. Like HTML, you add markers to plain text to style and organize the text of a document.</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>In HTML: \n",
      "&lt;h1&gt; Heading 1 &lt;/h1&gt;\n",
      "\n",
      "In Markdown:\n",
      "# Heading 1\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Whereas you use HTML and CSS with WordPress, you use Markdown with GitHub. Markdown has fewer options for marking text than HTML. It was designed to be human-readable, meaning easy to write and edit. </p>\n",
      "<p>This file you are reading is written in markdown—<a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/master/sections/concept.md\">here</a> is what it looks like in its raw, unrendered form.</p>\n",
      "<p>Compare that with this - the source code for the GitHub page, written in HTML: view-source:https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git</p>\n",
      "<p>Markdown is also arguably more sustainable and accessible than formats like <code>.docx</code> because of its simplicity and related ability to be read across multiple platforms. Use of Markdown is also supported by document-conversion tools like <a href=\"https://pandoc.org/\">Pandoc</a> that can change a markdown file to an epub with one command entered into your terminal.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Highlighting Distinctions</h2>\n",
      "<p>As we move forward its important to make sure we're firm on the distinctions between the three different tools outlined above. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Git</strong> is a software that you use on your laptop, or your local computer/machine. The repository with your project's files is stored on your hard drive. You also edit the text files on your local machine using a plain text editor, which is another software on your local machine like VS Code. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>GitHub</strong> is a cloud-based platform that you access through your internet browser. Even though you physically are still in the same place, working on your laptop, you are no longer working on your local machine, you are on the Internet. This is a fundamentally different location than when you're working with your Git repository and editing and creating files in your plain text editor. With GitHub, you are uploading your repository - as described above - from your local machine to this platform on the Internet to be shared more broadly. You can also create private repositories if you want to use GitHub to backup a project.  </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Markdown</strong> is the language used to format the plain text files in your Git-enabled repository. GitHub reads this language so that the markups made to the file are rendered when you view your file on the platform (i.e. #headers appears as headers, links are inserted).</p>\n",
      "<h1>What You Can Do with Git and GitHub</h1>\n",
      "<p>A <a href=\"https://digitalscholarship.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/spirosmithdh2016githubpresentationfinal.pdf\">study of how Digital Humanists use GitHub</a>, conducted by Lisa Spiro and Sean Morey Smith, found that a wide range of users, including professors, research staff, graduate students, IT staff, and librarians commonly used the site in their DH work. They used GitHub for a diverse range of activities, such as:</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>Developing software</li>\n",
      "<li>Sharing data sets</li>\n",
      "<li>Creating websites</li>\n",
      "<li>Writing articles and books</li>\n",
      "<li>Collating online resources</li>\n",
      "<li>Keeping research notes</li>\n",
      "<li>Hosting syllabi and course materials</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<h2>Why Use GitHub?</h2>\n",
      "<p>Participants in the study said they found GitHub useful in their Digital Humanities work for several reasons. In particular, it facilitated: </p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>Sharing and backing up files on multiple computers</li>\n",
      "<li>Monitoring changes effectively</li>\n",
      "<li>Recovering from bugs or errors by going back in time before the error arose</li>\n",
      "<li>Using different branches for experiments and new directions</li>\n",
      "<li>Sharing and managing files with others—seeing who added what content and when</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<h2>How We Use GitHub:</h2>\n",
      "<h3>Sharing and Attribution</h3>\n",
      "<p>As you can see across these sessions, we use GitHub to host workshop curricula. Hosting sessions on GitHub allows you (and anyone else interested in these topics!) to follow our repositories, and create your own version of the workshop based on our materials. This fosters open scholarship and knowledge sharing. It also facilitates attribution and citation by clearly tracking which content was created by whom, when it was added, and which projects or materials are derived from others.</p>\n",
      "<h4>Case One: This Session</h4>\n",
      "<p>If you look just under the workshop title, <code>DHRI-Curriculum/git</code> at the top of this page, you can see it is <code>forked from pswee001/Git_DRI_Jan_2018</code>. That line shows that this particular repository is building on (<em>\"forked from\"</em>) the curriculum for a session I presented at our January 2018 Institute. If you then look at that repository, you will see that it is in turn forked from previous sessions that were developed by other GC Digital Fellows for workshops in past years. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Forking</strong> is a proper function of the GitHub platform. It supports collaboration by allowing you to copy someone else's repository to your own account on GitHub while maintaining a trail of attribution and derivation. This function is described in further detail in the final lesson of this workshop.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Collaborative Writing</h3>\n",
      "<p>Git is also used to track changes (<em>version control</em> in Git parlance) in writing projects, especially when there are multiple authors working asynchronously. It can be an alternative to using track changes in Microsoft Word, or comments and edits in a Google Doc.</p>\n",
      "<h4>Case Two: Coauthored Publications</h4>\n",
      "<p>Git and GitHub - together or independently - support multi-author publishing. Like we have done with the DHRI curriculum, you can have a shared project folder that multiple people are working from asynchronously, even on the same parts if they wanted, and then those different offshoots can be carefully folded back into the master project. This entails the process of creating <em>branches</em> and <em>merging</em>.</p>\n",
      "<p>Git and GitHub also help with attribution by tracking individual contributions throughout. Additional branches could be created by a singular author as well, allowing the writer to explore different ways forward. The version control feature also allows authors to easily return to and compare older drafts or retrieve sections previoulsy discarded. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Branches</strong> and <strong>merging</strong> are important functionalities when using Git to collaborate, but they are also advanced and thus beyond the scope of this workshop. See the <em>Resources</em> section at the end of the workshop for more information.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Versions Across Time</h3>\n",
      "<p>How did you initially come by the syllabus you use for your class, and did you develop it over time? Many professors borrow and adapt from each other, and most of us probably update our syllabi each semester, even if only a little bit.</p>\n",
      "<p>Put your hand up if you have a folder somewhere that looks something like this. Or even multiple folders. </p>\n",
      "<pre><code>|\n",
      "--Documents\n",
      "   |\n",
      "   --syllabus.doc\n",
      "   --syllabus2.doc \n",
      "   --syllabusnew.doc \n",
      "   --syllabusRevised.doc \n",
      "   --syllabusFINAL.doc \n",
      "   --syllabus?.doc \n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Ok, hands down. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Consider the following questions as well:</strong>\n",
      "- Can you remember who you initially got this syllabus from?\n",
      "- Do you know if there were other contributors along with or before them? \n",
      "- Do you acknowledge prior contributors somewhere on your syllabus? \n",
      "- Can you or others see what changes have been made to the syllabus over time? </p>\n",
      "<h4>Case Three: Syllabi</h4>\n",
      "<p>Increasingly we see that faculty are sharing their syllabi on GitHub. Some are even using GitPages that apply a user-friendly interface to their repository to make it easier to access and navigate for their students. This is because Git and GitHub make it easy to make contributors and changes to documents over time visible. </p>\n",
      "<p>Using Git and GitHub, you could fork that syllabi to your account, and download - or <em>clone</em> as Git calls it - it to your local machine to edit. After making changes to the files and and reuploading them or <em>pushing</em> them to the repo (short for repository) on GitHub, someone else could compare the changes you made and see who the original or additional contributors were. They could also decide to continue the chain by copying or forking your version, or decide to return to the original repo and fork that version. Both Git and GitHub help with attribution here; tracking who changes and adds what is a key feature of both tools.</p>\n",
      "<p>Even if you were only working with your own self-created syllabus, like we'll do later in this workshop, Git and GitHub can be useful for tracking your changes without the hassle of multiple files. From one file, you can use Git to compare your current version with older versions; you can also compare and share these different versions on GitHub.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Cloning</strong> and <strong>pushing</strong> are proper functionalities of GitHub that describe how you communicate and share files between your local machine and the Internet. These are covered more in-depth in a later lesson in this workshop.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Review of the Command Line</h1>\n",
      "<p>During this workshop, you'll be communicating with GitHub from our local machine via the command line (terminal, bash). It will be useful if you've taken <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/command-line\">the Command Line Workshop</a> before continuing. This section reviews some of the basic commands that will also be used in this workshop.  </p>\n",
      "<p>In addition to the command line, you'll be using your text editor and your browser. Before continuing, its important that we clearly distinguish between these three different spaces or environments:\n",
      "- Your plain text editor where you'll be writing your syllabus in Markdown is on your local machine. \n",
      "- That syllabus is intiailly saved in a git-enabled repository on your local machine.\n",
      "- Your browser is where you'll be uploading your repository to GitHub.\n",
      "- Your terminal is where you'll be communicating with GitHub to send the repository and project files back and forth between the web and your hard drive. </p>\n",
      "<p>Because you'll be moving between these three spaces throughout the workshop, you may want to use (command + tab) or (ctrl + tab) to move quickly between the three windows on your desktop.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Accessing the Terminal</h2>\n",
      "<h3>Mac OS</h3>\n",
      "<p>Press the space bar and the command key at the same time and type <code>terminal</code>. Press <code>Enter</code>.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Windows</h3>\n",
      "<p>Press the Windows button on your keyboard. When the search menu pops up, type <code>git bash</code> and press <code>Enter</code>.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Practice Navigating the Command Line</h2>\n",
      "<p>In this session, we will be making a syllabus and using Git to keep track of our revisions. Let's create a Git project folder</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>cd &lt;directory-name&gt; \n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>will let you navigate inside a directory of your choosing.</p>\n",

      "<pre><code>cd Desktop\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>and hit <code>Enter</code>. This will change your current working directory from <code>/Users/&lt;your-name&gt;</code> to <code>/Users/&lt;your-name&gt;/Desktop</code>.</p>\n",
      "<p>To check your current directory, type</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>pwd\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Try this now to make sure you're in your Desktop directory.</p>\n",
      "<p>Now, use </p>\n",
      "<pre><code>cd ..\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>to go up one directory. In this case, this will take you back to your home directory.</p>\n",
      "<p>Practice going back and forth between your Desktop and your home directory.</p>\n",
      "<p>When finished, go to your Desktop folder and check that you're there with <code>pwd</code>.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Making a Git Project Folder</h2>\n",
      "<p>If you've worked through the command line session, you should see a <code>projects</code> folder on your desktop. Navigate into it with</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>cd projects\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If you don't have a projects folder on your desktop, create one with</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>mkdir projects\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>From <code>Desktop</code>, navigate into your <code>projects</code> folder. Then create a <code>git-practice</code> folder with the below command:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>mkdir git-practice\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Enter the new <code>git</code> folder with</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>cd git-practice\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>At this point, when you type <code>pwd</code>, your folder structure should look like this:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>/home/&lt;username&gt;/Desktop/projects/git-practice\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<h1>Setting Up Git</h1>\n",
      "<p>Our first step in working with Git is letting the software know who we are so it can track our work and attribute our contributions. Through this section, you'll be checking your installation and configuring Git with your own name and information.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Check Your Install</h2>\n",
      "<p>Let's make sure Git has been successfully installed. In your terminal, type</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>git --version\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If you see a version number, you're all set. If not, click <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/downloads\">here</a> and install as you would any other software on your system.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Configuring Git on Your Computer</h2>\n",
      "<p>Next, let's configure git so that it can identify who we are. This information is useful because it connects identifying information with the changes you make in your repository. </p>\n",
      "<p>Type the following into your command line, filling in the sections—below labeled \"John Doe\"—for your name and email (use quotations where you see them). This does not necessarily need to be the name and email you used to sign up for GitHub. Remember, these are different spaces and softwares.</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>git config --global user.name &quot;John Doe&quot;\n",
      "git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>To check your set-up, use:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>git config --list\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>You'll get something that looks like this:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>user.name=Superstar Git User\n",
      "user.email=gitsuperstar@gmail.com\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<h1>Creating a Syllabus with Markdown</h1>\n",
      "<p>Using <code>cd</code>, navigate to the <code>git-practice</code> folder inside <code>projects</code>. From your home directory, type:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>cd Desktop/projects/git-practice\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "<p>Now we're going to <strong>initialize</strong> our repository, which means telling Git to pay attention to it:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>git init\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "<p>You should see output like this:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>Initialized empty Git repository in /home/patrick/projects/git/.git/\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "<p>Now Git is tracking our directory. Importantly, it has not done any versioning yet. There is no history of changes as of yet: 1) because there are no files and we haven't made any changes, 2) becuase we have to tell Git when to take a snapshot, which we go through in the next section. For now, Git knows this folder exists and is prepared to take a snapshot of the files when you tel it to.</p>\n",
      "<p>Before version control useful, we'll have to create a text file for Git to track. For this session, the file we'll track will be a course syllabus—we'll create that next.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Creating a Syllabus in Markdown</h3>\n",
      "<p>To create a plain text file, we're going to switch to our text editor, VS Code, to create and edit a file named <code>syllabus.md</code> and save it to our 'git-practice' folder. If you have not installed VS Code, review <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/vscode.md\">the installation instructions here</a>.</p>\n",
      "<p>In terminal, check to make sure you are in your <code>git-practice</code> folder. (HINT: use 'pwd' to see what directory you are currently in) Next, type:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>code syllabus.md\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "<p>to open a <code>syllabus.md</code> file in VS Code. You should see a window appear that looks similar to this:</p>\n",
      "<p><img alt=\"Image of what VS Code looks like when opening the syllabus.md file\" src=\"../images/vscode1.png\" /></p>\n",
      "<p>If VS Code does not open when you use the <code>code</code> command in your terminal, open it using the Start Menu on Windows or Spotlight Search on Mac OS as you would any other software. Then click <code>File &gt; Open File</code> and use the dialog to navigate to the <code>/Users/&lt;your-name&gt;/Desktop/projects/git</code> folder and create a <code>syllabus.md</code> file there.</p>\n",
      "<p>We'll be typing our markdown into this file in the VS Code window. At any time, you can save your file by hitting <code>Control-s</code> on Windows or <code>⌘-s</code> on Mac OS. Alternatively, you can click the <code>File</code> menu on the top right, then select <code>Save</code> from the dropdown menu.</p>\n",
      "<p>Saving frequently is advised. When we get to the version contol functionality of Git, only changes that are saved will be preserved when a version is created. </p>\n",
      "<h2>Using Markdown</h2>\n",
      "<p>We'll be using markdown to write a syllabus, and then using Git to track any changes we make to it. Markdown allows us to format textual features like headings, emphasis, links, and lists in a plain text file using a streamlined set of notations that humans can interpret without much training. Markdown files usually have a <code>.md</code> extension.</p>\n",
      "<p>In markdown, we insert headings with a single hash mark like this:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>    # My Syllabus Heading\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A sub-heading (H2) heading uses two hash marks like this:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>    ## Readings\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>To provide emphasis, place asterisks around some text:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>    *This text will appear italicized.*\n",
      "    **This text will appear bold.**\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For emphasis, you need to mark where it should start and where it should end, so you need astrisks at the beginning and end of whatever text is being emphasized.</p>\n",
      "<p>To create a bulleted list, put a hyphen at the beginning of each list item:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>    - Reading one\n",
      "    - Reading two\n",
      "    - Reading three\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>To create a link, put the anchor text (the text you will see) in square brackets and the URL in parentheses. Don't put a space between them:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>    I teach at [The Graduate Center, CUNY](https://www.gc.cuny.edu).\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Paragraphs of text are denoted by putting a blank line between them:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>&gt; This is a paragraph in markdown. It's separated from the paragraph below with a blank line. If you know HTML, it's kind of like the \\&lt;p&gt; tag. That means that there is a little space before and after the paragraph when it is rendered.\n",
      "&gt; \n",
      "&gt; This is a second paragraph in markdown, which I'll use to tell you what I like about markdown. I like markdown because it looks pretty good, if minimal, whether you're looking at the rendered or unrendered version. It's like tidy HTML.\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Try using these five elements—headings, emphasis, lists, links, and paragraphs—to create a syllabus. Have a main heading that gives the course title (one <code>#</code>), then subheadings for, at least, course info and readings. Use emphasis (<code>*</code>) for book titles and try to get a list in there somewhere.</p>\n",
      "<p>You can look at an example syllabus in raw text form <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/master/sections/syllabus.md\">here</a>. When it's rendered by GitHub, it looks like <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/blob/master/sections/syllabus.md\">this</a>. When editing the markdown file in VS Code, it might look like this:</p>\n",
      "<p><img alt=\"What your markdown might look like when typed into VS Code\" src=\"../images/vscode2.png\" /></p>\n",
      "<p>VS Code also has a preview feature for your markdown. Hit the preview button on the top right while editing your markdown file:</p>\n",
      "<p><img alt=\"Button to hit to get a preview in VS Code\" src=\"../images/vscode3.png\" /></p>\n",
      "<p>You'll get two side-by-side panels. Your markdown file will be on the left, and your rendered preview will be on the right:</p>\n",
      "<p><img alt=\"Side by side markdown and preview in VS Code\" src=\"../images/vscode4.png\" /></p>\n",
      "<p>Remember to save your work with <code>Control-s</code> on Windows or <code>⌘-s</code> on Mac OS.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Staging and Committing Changes</h1>\n",
      "<p>Git's primary function is version control, or to track a project as it exists at different points in time. Now that we have a file to track—our markdown syllabus—let's use Git to save the current state of the repository as it exists now.</p>\n",
      "<h2>A Metaphor for Adding and Committing</h2>\n",
      "<p>In Git, a <strong>commit</strong> is a snapshot of a repository that is entered into its permanent history. To commit a change to a repository, we take two steps:</p>\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li>Adding files to a \"staging area,\" meaning that we intend to commit them. </li>\n",
      "<li>Finalizing the commit.</li>\n",
      "</ol>\n",
      "<p>Staging a file or files is you telling Git, \"hey! pay attention these files and the changes in them\". \n",
      "Making a commit is a lot like taking a photo. First, you have to decide who will be in the photo and arrange your friends or family in front of the camera (the staging process). Once everyone is present and ready, you take the picture, entering that moment into the permanent record (the commit process).</p>\n",
      "<h2>Staging Changes with the Add Command</h2>\n",
      "<p>First, let's see what state Git is currently in. It's a good idea to use this command before and after doing anything in Git so you can always be on the same page as the computer.</p>\n",
      "<p>Make sure you're in your <code>/home/&lt;your-name&gt;/Desktop/projects/git-practice</code> directory using the <code>pwd</code> command in the terminal. Once you're there, enter this command:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>    git status\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>This means we've initialized our repository, but haven't made any commits yet. If you're instead getting a message that begins with the word <code>fatal</code> when you use <code>git status</code>, you may be in the wrong directory or perhaps you haven't run the <code>git init</code> command on your directory yet.</p>\n",
      "<p>Let's follow the recommendation in the status message above and use the <code>add</code> command to stage files, making them ready to be committed.</p>\n",

      "</code></pre>\n",
      "<p>The <code>-m</code> flag provides a message along with the commit that will tell others—or remind a future version of yourself—what the commit was all about. Try not to type <code>git commit</code> without the <code>-m</code> flag for now—there's a note about this below.</p>\n",
      "<p>After running the command, you should see output like this:</p>\n",

      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This means that everything in the repository is successfully committed and up-to-date. If you edit your syllabus file or create a new file in the repository, the message you get with <code>git status</code> will instead list files that have uncommitted changes.</p>\n",
      "<p>Let's run one other command to see the effect our commit has had. Enter this command:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>git log\n",

      "<h2>Why Do We Need to Use the -m Flag?</h2>\n",
      "<p>The -m flag is useful for human purposes and technical purposes. For human purposes, the -m flag helps you keep track of the changes you're making. Version control is most useful when you can confidently return to a specific version. It can also help you be more structured in your approach to making changes - your notes to self are limited, so to make the clear you might make commits after specific tasks are completed, such as: update readings for week 1 - X Author added.This can also make it easier to reverse a specific change in the future. </p>\n",
      "<p>Also, if you type <code>git commit</code> by itself, git will open the command line's default text editor to allow you to enter the commit message. Unfortunately, the default text editor, <code>vi</code>, requires some knowledge to use, and we don't teach it as part of our sessions.</p>\n",
      "<p>If you find yourself stuck in an unfamiliar screen in the command line after running <code>git commit</code>, you're probably in <code>vi</code>. Type this to leave that environment and return to the <code>$</code> prompt:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>:q\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "<p>If you're ever stuck or \"trapped\" on the command line, try running through these common exit commands to return to the prompt:</p>\n",

      "Control-d\n",
      "q\n",
      ":q\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><code>Control-c</code> attempts to abort the current task and restore user control. <code>Control-d</code> escapes the current shell environment—if you use it at the normal <code>$</code> prompt, it will end the current command line session. <code>q</code> is used to escape from specific utilities like <code>less</code>. <code>:q</code> first changes the mode in <code>vi</code>, allowing you to enter the <code>q</code> key to quit, so it's a command specific to <code>vi</code>.</p>\n",

      "<li>Click <code>Create repository</code>.</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<p>You should end up inside your newly created git-practice repo. It will look like a set of instructions that you might want to use to connect your GitHub repository to a local repository.</p>\n",

      "</code></pre>\n",
      "<p>You'll need the command copied from your new repo, since it will contain the correct URL.</p>\n",

      "<p>We have covered the basic steps of creating a file and tracking changes within a file on your local machine and on GitHub. </p>\n",
      "<p>This have involved coordinating across three different environments, so let's go through that one more time. Note that this process is very slightly different. I'll highlight it when it comes up. </p>\n",
      "<p>To start, let's add something to our syllabus. Another week of materials or a new reading. </p>\n",
      "<p>Save that file. </p>\n",
      "<p>Use <code>git add</code> via the command line to stage the file - tell Git what document you want it to pay attention to. </p>\n",
      "<p>Use <code>git commit</code> via the command line to save the changes you've just made as a snapshot or new version of you file. Remember to heed to -m and include a message about the change you just made. </p>\n",
      "<p>So far, we have not done anything with GitHub or on the Internet. We have used Git, installed on our local machine, to save a version of file as it stands how. We could stop here if we only had an interest in using Git for version control. But if we also wanted to use GitHub to back up our files, or to share our project with a team or publicly, we want to upload, or push, that repository to GitHub, which is accessible view the Internet. </p>\n",
      "<p>Use <code>git push origin master</code> to push that file to your repository on GitHub. After refreshing the webpage, your file should appear online. The difference I noted above appears here. Note the absense of the <code>-u</code> flag from the command. That flag established the connection between the repository on your local machine and on GitHub. After that, it knows where to push so it doesn't need that indication.   </p>\n",
      "<h2>Challenge</h2>\n",
      "<p>Challenge yourself by going the process a few more times by adding additional readings and weeks of course material. </p>\n",
      "<p>Also try creating a new file and adding an assignment. Rewrite the assignment using Markdown, or edit and add in the markers. Go through the process of staging and commiting that file, and pushing it to your repository on GitHub. </p>\n",
      "<h1>Cloning &amp; Forking</h1>\n",
      "<p>GitHub was built for sharing and collaborating on projects. A key advantage of that platform is that you can find lots of bits of software that do many different things - such as code for plugins for WordPress or Leaflet. Increasingly, you might find syllabi or open writing projects. If a project is public, you can save a copy of it, work on it, save your admendations and share it on your own GitHub account. Like we've already mentioned, GitHub usefully helps track attribution along the say.</p>\n",
      "<p>Cloning and forking are the basic functions of this capability. Each are first explained below, and followed by an example and activity to further explain. </p>\n",
      "<h2>Cloning</h2>\n",
      "<p><strong>Cloning</strong> a repository means making a copy of a repository on GitHub, to download and work on locally - on your local machine. By entering the following code into your terminal, you can clone any public directory on GitHub: </p>\n",
      "<pre><code>git clone &lt;repository-url&gt;\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When you clone a repository from GitHub, the folder that shows up on your local machine comes built-in with a few things. First, Git is already present, so you don't need to initialize the folder. Also, the connection between your local copy and the online repository is already made, so <code>git push origin master</code> will work. </p>\n",
      "<p>For practice, let's clone the repository for this workshop about Git and GitHub.</p>\n",
      "<p>First, let's navigate back to your Desktop folder.</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>cd ~/Desktop\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "<p>Remember that the ~ refers to your home directory. Now let's find the URL we need to clone the lesson.</p>\n",
      "<p>First, follow <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git\">this link to the main page of this lesson on Git and GitHub</a>.</p>\n",
      "<p>On the main page, there should be a green <code>Clone or download</code> button on the right side:</p>\n",
      "<p><img alt=\"Image pointing out where the clone or download button is on GitHub\" src=\"../images/clone.png\" /></p>\n",
      "<p>Click the green button and you will see a box with highlighted text under a heading that says <code>Clone with HTTPS</code>. If you instead see <code>Cloning with SSH</code>, click the small link that says <code>Use HTTPS</code>.</p>\n",
      "<p>Now copy out the text in the box:</p>\n",
      "<p><img alt=\"Image showing where the text you need to copy is located\" src=\"../images/copy-clone-text.png\" /></p>\n",
      "<p>Now that you have the text copied, go back to your terminal. Remember, you should be on the desktop.</p>\n",
      "<p>Type</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>git clone &lt;copied-url&gt;\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "<p>If the command is successful, the full Git lesson will be replicated on your local machine. You can type</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>cd git\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "<p>to enter the lesson folder, since the lesson repository is simply called <code>git</code>. Use the <code>ls</code> command to take a look at the various files in the lesson folder.</p>\n",
      "<p>Cloning can be especially useful when you're joining a group project that is hosted on GitHub, and you want your changes to eventually be pushed and shared with that same repository. </p>\n",
      "<p>Forking is a step you migth take before closing, if you want to establish a separate home for the future changes you make to the repository on your GitHub account rather than push to an existing folder owned by someone else on GitHub. </p>\n",
      "<h2>Forking</h2>\n",
      "<p><strong>Forking</strong> a repository means making a copy of someone else's repository on GitHub, and saving it to your account on GitHub. This function happens within GitHub, and has nothing to do with what is happening on your local machine. </p>\n",
      "<p>For example, go to <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git\">the repository for this workshop</a> on GitHub. Note the <code>Fork</code> button in the upper right hand corner. By clicking that button, you could fork, or copy, this repository to your account. In the upper left hand corner, it would say your account name instead of <code>DHRI-Curriculum</code>, instead it will reference our account below after <code>forked from</code>. </p>\n",
      "<p>Your local machine would come into play when you want to <strong>clone</strong> that repository so you can work on it locally. This also means that when you push those changes to GitHub, you would be pushing them to a forked repository associated with your own account. </p>\n",
      "<p>You might use this method is you were going to teach your own Git &amp; GitHub workshop. You might want to use our repository as a base for getting started, but maybe you want to add more examples or changes some language, clarify something further, or create a connection to another workshop you are giving, etc. This allows us to continue to use the workshop as we have it as well. Or maybe at a later time, we want to merge some of your changes with ours. We can do that too by revisiting your version history. </p>\n",
      "<h2>Challenge</h2>\n",
      "<p>As we're the end of this lesson, here's a challenge that tests how much you've learned through this introduction. </p>\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li>Fork and clone <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git\">the repository for this workshop</a>. Note not only <em>what</em> you are doing, but also <em>where</em> you working when completing these two different tasks.</li>\n",
      "<li>Make changes to the files on your local machine. Remember to save them!</li>\n",
      "<li>Use the 3-step process of stage, commit and push to return the amended files to the repository on GitHub. </li>\n",
      "</ol>\n",
      "<h1>Overview</h1>\n",
      "<p>This tutorial will give a brief overview of the considerations and tools involved in basic text analysis with Python. By completing this tutorial, you will have a general sense of how to turn text into data using the Python package, NLTK. You will also be able to take publicly available text files and transform them into a corpus that you can perform your own analysis on. Finally, you will have some insight into the types of questions that can be addressed with text analysis.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Cloning the repository</h2>\n",
      "<p>Before getting started, clone <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/text-analysis\">this repository</a> to your local machine. Instructions for cloning Git repositories can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/blob/master/sections/cloning.md\">here</a>.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Setup and installation</h2>\n",
      "<p>If you have not already installed the <a href=\"https://www.anaconda.com/download/\">Anaconda</a> distribution of Python 3, please do so.</p>\n",
      "<p>You will also need <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/nltk.md\"><code>nltk</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/conda.md\"><code>matplotlib</code></a> to complete this tutorial. Both packages come installed with Anaconda. To check to be sure you have them, open a new Jupyter Notebook (or any IDE to run Python).</p>\n",
      "<p>Find Anaconda Navigator on your computer (it should be located in the folder with your other applications), and from Acadonda Navigator's interface, launch a Jupyter Notebook.</p>\n",
      "<p><img alt=\"jupyter\" src=\"images/jupyter.png\" /></p>\n",
      "<p>It will open in the browser. All of the directories (folders) in your home directory will appear - we'll get to that later. For now, select 'New' &gt;&gt; Python3 in the upper right corner.</p>\n",
      "<p><img alt=\"jupyter\" src=\"images/jupyter1.png\" /></p>\n",
      "<p>A blank page with an empty box should appear.</p>\n",
      "<p><img alt=\"jupyter\" src=\"images/jupyter2.png\" /></p>\n",
      "<p>In the box, type:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">import nltk\n",
      "import matplotlib\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Press <strong>Shift</strong> + <strong>Enter</strong> to run the cell (or click run at the top of the page). Don't worry too much about what this is doing - that will be explained later in this tutorial. For now, we just want to make sure the packages we will need are installed.</p>\n",
      "<p><img alt=\"jupyter\" src=\"images/jupyter3.png\" /></p>\n",
      "<p>If nothing happens, they are installed and you are ready to move on! If you get an error message, either you have a typo or they are not installed. If it is the latter, open the command line and type:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"bash\">conda install nltk -y\n",
      "conda install matplotlib -y\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Now we need to install the nltk corpus. This is very large and may take some time if you are on a weak connection.</p>\n",
      "<p>In the next cell, type:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">nltk.download()\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>and run the cell.</p>\n",
      "<p>The NLTK downloader should appear. Please install all of the packages. If you are short on time, focus on book\" for this tutorial—you can download the other packages at another time for later use.</p>\n",
      "<p>Yours will look a little different, but the same interface. Click on the 'all' option and then 'Download'. Once they all trun green, you can close the Downloader dialogue box.</p>\n",
      "<p><img alt=\"nltk downloader\" src=\"images/nltk.png\" /></p>\n",
      "<p>Return to your Jupyter Notebook and type:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">from nltk.book import *\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A list of books should appear. If this happens, great! If not, return to the downloader to make sure everything is ok.</p>\n",
      "<p>Close this Notebook without saving - the only purpose was to check if we have the appropriate packages installed.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Text as Data</h1>\n",
      "<p>When we think of \"data,\" we often think of numbers, things that can be summarized, statisticized, and graphed. Rarely when I ask people \"what is data?\" do they respond \"<em>Moby Dick</em>.\" And yet, more and more, text is data. Whether it is <em>Moby Dick</em>, or every romance novel written since 1750, or today's newspaper or twitter feed, we are able to transform written (and spoken) language into data that can be quantified and visualized.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Corpora</h2>\n",
      "<p>The first step in gathering insights from texts is to create a <strong>corpus</strong>. A corpus is a collection of texts that are somehow related to each other. For example, the <a href=\"https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/\">Corpus of Contemporary American English</a>, <a href=\"http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/\">Donald Trump's Tweets</a>, <a href=\"https://byts.commons.gc.cuny.edu/\">text messages</a> sent by bilingual young adults, <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers/\">digitized newspapers</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/\">books</a> in the public domain are all corpora. There are infinitely many corpora, and, sometimes, you will want to make your own—that is, one that best fits your research question.</p>\n",
      "<p>The route you take from here will depend on your research question. Let's say, for example, that you want to examine gender differences in writing style. Based on previous linguistic research, you hypothesize that male-identified authors use more definitives than female-identified. So you collect two corpora—one written by men, one written by women—and you count the number of <em>the</em>s, <em>this</em>s, and <em>that</em>s compared to the number of <em>a</em>s, <em>an</em>s, and <em>one</em>s. Maybe you find a difference, maybe you don't. We can already see that this is a relatively crude way of going about answering this question, but it is a start. (More likely, you'd use a <em>supervised classification task</em>, which you will learn about in the <a href=\"https://www.github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/machine-learning\">Machine Learning Tutorial</a>.)</p>\n",
      "<p>There has been some research about how the <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/331/6014/176.full.pdf\">linguistic complexity of written language</a> in long-form pieces (i.e., books, articles, letters, etc.) has decreased over time. Simply put, people today use shorter sentences with fewer embedded clauses and complex tense constructions than people did in the past. (Note that this is not necessarily a bad or good thing.) Based on this research, we want to know if short-form platforms are emblematic of the change (we predict that they are based on our own experience with short-form platforms like email and Twitter). One way to do this would be to use Part-of-Speech tagging. Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a way to identify the category of words in a given text.</p>\n",
      "<p>For example, the sentence:</p>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>I like the red bicycle.</p>\n",
      "</blockquote>\n",
      "<p>has one pronoun, one verb, one determiner, one adjective, and one noun.</p>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>(I : Pronoun), (like : Verb), (the : Determiner), (red : Adjective), (bicycle : Noun)</p>\n",
      "</blockquote>\n",
      "<p>NLTK uses the <a href=\"https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html\">Penn Tree Bank Tag Set</a>. This is a very detailed tag list that goes far beyond just nouns, verbs, and adjectives, but gives insight into different types of nouns, prepositions, and verbs as well. Virtually all POS taggers will create a list of (word, POS) pairs. If newspaper articles have a higher ratio of function words (prepositions, auxiliaries, determiners, etc.) to semantic words (nouns, verbs, adjectives), than tweets, then we have one piece of evidence supporting our hypothesis. It's important to note here that we must use either ratios or otherwise normalized data (in the sense that raw numbers will not work). Because of the way that language works (function words are often repeated, for example), a sample of 100 words will have more unique words than a sample of 1,000. Therefore, to compare different data types (articles vs. tweets), this fact should be taken into account.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Cleaning and Normalizing</h1>\n",
      "<p>Generally, however, our questions are more about topics rather than writing style. So, once we have a corpus—whether that is one text or millions—we usually want to clean and normalize it. There are three terms we are going to need:</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li><strong>Text normalization</strong> is the process of taking a list of words and transforming it into a more uniform sequence. Usually, this involves removing punctuation, making the words all the same case, removing <em>stop words</em>, and either <em>stemming</em> or <em>lemmatizing</em> the words. It can also include expanding abbreviations or matching misspellings (but these are advanced practices that we will not cover).</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<p>You probably know what removing punctuation and capitalization refer to, but the other terms may be new:</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>\n",
      "<p><strong>Stop words</strong> are words that appear frequently in a language, often adding grammatical structure, but little semantic content. There is no official list of stop words for any language, though there are some common, all-purpose lists built in to NLTK. However, different tasks require different lists. The purpose of removing stop words is to remove words that are so common that their meaning is diminished across a large number of texts.</p>\n",
      "</li>\n",
      "<li>\n",
      "<p><strong>Stemming and lemmatizing</strong> both of these processes try to consolidate words like \"laughs\" and \"laughing\" to  \"laugh\" since they all mean essentially the same thing, they are just inflected differently. So again, in an attempt to reduce the number of words, and get a realistic understanding of the meaning of a text, these words are collapsed. Stemming does this by cutting off the end (very fast), lemmatizing does this by looking up the dictionary form (very slow).</p>\n",
      "</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<p>Language is messy, and created for and by people, not computers. There is a lot of grammatical information in a sentence that a computer cannot use. For example, I could say to you:</p>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>The house is burning.</p>\n",
      "</blockquote>\n",
      "<p>and you would understand me. You would also understand if I say</p>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>house burn.</p>\n",
      "</blockquote>\n",
      "<p>The first has more information about tense, and which house in particular, but the sentiment is the same either way.</p>\n",
      "<p>In going from the first sentence to the normalized words, we removed the stop words (<em>the</em> and <em>is</em>), and removed punctuation and case, and lemmatized what was left (<em>burning</em> becomes <em>burn</em>—though we might have stemmed this, its impossible to tell from the example). This results in what is essentially a \"bag of words,\" or a corpus of words without any structure. Because normalizing your text reduces the number of words (and therefore the number of dimensions in your data), and keeps only the words that contribute meaning to the document, this cleaning is usually desirable.</p>\n",
      "<p>Again, this will be covered more in depth in the Machine Learning Tutorial, but for the time being, we just need to know that there is \"clean\" and \"dirty\" versions of text data. Sometimes our questions are about the clean data, but sometimes our questions are in the \"dirt.\"</p>\n",
      "<h2>Words into numbers</h2>\n",
      "<p>In the next section, we are going to go through a series of methods that come built-in to NLTK that allow us to turn our words into numbers and visualizations. This is just scratching the surface, but should give you an idea of what is possible beyond just counting words.</p>\n",
      "<h1>NLTK Methods with the NLTK Corpus</h1>\n",
      "<p>All of the code for this section is in a Jupyter Notebook in the GitHub repository. I encourage you to follow along by retyping all of the code, but if you get lost, or want another reference, the code is there as well.</p>\n",
      "<p>To open the notebook, first create a <code>projects</code> folder if you don't already have one by entering this command in your terminal:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"console\">mkdir -p ~/Desktop/projects\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If you already have a projects folder, you can skip this step.</p>\n",
      "<p>Next, clone the text analysis session repository into your projects folder by entering this command:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"console\">git clone https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/text-analysis.git ~/Desktop/projects/text-analysis\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Then move to the new directory:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"console\">cd ~/Desktop/projects/text-analysis\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Now launch the Jupyter Notebook application by typing this into the terminal:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"console\">jupyter notebook\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If it's your first time opening the notebook, you may be prompted to enter a URL into your browser. Copy out the URL and paste it into the Firefox or Google Chrome search bar.</p>\n",
      "<p>Finally, in the Jupyter Notebook file browser, find the notebook file and open it. It should be called <code>TextAnalysis.ipynb</code>. You will use this file for reference in case you get stuck in the next few sections, so keep it open.</p>\n",
      "<p>Return to the Jupyter Home Tab in your Browser (or Launch the Jupyter Notebook again), and start a New Python3 Notebook using the <code>New</code> button in the upper right corner.</p>\n",
      "<p>Even though Jupyter Notebook doesn't force you to do so, it is very important to name your file, or you will end up later with a bunch of untitled files and you will have no idea what they are about. In the top left, click in the word \"Untitled\" and give your file a name such as \"intro_nltk\".</p>\n",
      "<p>In the first blank cell, type the following to import the NLTK library:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">import nltk\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>Libraries</strong> are sets of instructions that Python can use to perform specialized functions. The Natural Language ToolKit (<code>nltk</code>) is one such library. As the name suggests, its focus is on language processing.</p>\n",
      "<p>We will also need the matplotlib library later on, so import it now:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">import matplotlib\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><code>matplotlib</code> is a library for making graphs. In the middle of this tutorial, we are going to make a dispersion plot of words in our texts.</p>\n",
      "<p>Finally, because of a quirk of Jupyter notebooks, we need to specify that matplotlib should display its graphs in the notebook (as opposed to in a separate window), so we type this command (this is technically a Jupyter command, not Python):</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">%matplotlib inline\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>All three of these commands can be written in the same cell and run all at once (<code>Shift + Enter</code>) or in different cells.</p>\n",
      "<p><img alt=\"Image showing that the three lines given above should be written in a single cell in the Jupyter notebook, one after another\" src=\"images/imports.png\" /></p>\n",

As discussed in the <a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/python\">Python tutorial LINK</a>, Python does not <em>evaluate</em> strings, so it just counts the number of characters on either side. By default, this is 25 characters on either side of our target word (including spaces).</p>\n",
      "<p>In the Jupyter Notebook, type:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">text1.concordance(&quot;whale&quot;)\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The output shows us the 25 characters on either side of the word \"whale\" in <em>Moby Dick</em>. Let's try this with another word, \"love.\" Just replace the word \"whale\" with \"love,\" and we get the contexts in which Melville uses \"love\" in <em>Moby Dick</em>. <code>concordance</code> is used (behind the scenes) for several other functions, including <code>similar</code> and <code>common_contexts</code>.</p>\n",
      "<p>Let's now see which words appear in similar contexts as the word \"love.\" NLTK has a built-in function for this as well: <code>similar</code>.</p>\n",

      "<p>Behind the scenes, Python found all the contexts where the word \"love\" appears. It also finds similar environments, and then what words were common among the similar contexts. This gives a sense of what other words appear in similar contexts. This is somewhat interesting, but more interesting if we can compare it to something else. Let's take a look at another text. What about <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>? Let's see what words are similar to \"love\" in Jane Austen's writing. In the next cell, type:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">text2.similar(&quot;love&quot;)\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",

      "<h2>Investigating \"lol\"</h2>\n",
      "<p>Let's expand from novels for a minute and take a look at the NLTK Chat Corpus. In chats, text messages, and other digital communication platforms, \"lol\" is exceedingly common. We know it doesn't simply mean \"laughing out loud\"—maybe the <code>similar</code> function can provide some insight into what it does mean.</p>\n",

Phatic language is language primarily for communicating social closeness. Phatic words stand in contrast to semantic words, which contribute meaning to the utterance.</p>\n",

      "<h1>Positioning Words</h1>\n",
      "<p>In many ways, <code>concordance</code> and <code>similar</code> are heightened word searches that tell us something about what is happening near the target words. Another metric we can use is to visualize where the words appear in the text. In the case of <em>Moby Dick</em>, we want to compare where \"whale\" and \"monster\" appear throughout the text. In this case, the text is functioning as a list of words, and will make a mark where each word appears, offset from the first word. We will <em>pass</em> this <em>function</em> a <em>list</em> of <em>strings</em> to plot. This will likely help us develop a visual of the story - where the whale goes from being a whale to being a monster to being a whale again. In the next cell, type:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">text1.dispersion_plot([&quot;whale&quot;, &quot;monster&quot;])\n",

      "<p>A graph should appear with a tick mark everywhere that \"whale\" appears and everywhere that \"monster\" appears. Knowing the story, we can interpret this graph and align it to what we know of how the narrative progresses. If we did not know the story, this could give us a picture of the narrative arc.</p>\n",
      "<p>Try this with <code>text2</code>, <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>. Some relevant words are \"marriage,\" \"love,\" \"home,\" \"mother,\" \"husband,\" \"sister,\" and \"wife.\" Pick a few to compare. You can compare an unlimited number, but it's easier to read a few at a time. (Note that the comma in our writing here is <em>inside</em> the quotation mark but for Python, this would be unreadable and you would have to put commas outside of quotation marks to create a <em>list</em>.)</p>\n",
      "<p>NLTK has many more functions built-in, but some of the most powerful functions are related to cleaning, part-of-speech tagging, and other stages in the text analysis pipeline (where the pipeline refers to the process of loading, cleaning, and analyzing text).</p>\n",
      "<h1>Built-In Python Functions</h1>\n",
      "<p>We will now turn our attention away from the NLTK library and work with our text using the built-in Python functions—the ones that come included with the Python language, rather than the NLTK library.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Types vs. tokens</h2>\n",
      "<p>First, let's find out how many times a given word appears in the corpus. In this case (and all cases going forward), our text will be treated as a list of words. Therefore, we will use the <code>count</code> function. We could just as easily do this with a text editor, but performing this in Python allows us to save it to a variable and then utilize this statistic in other calculations (for example, if we want to know what percentage of words in a corpus are 'lol', we would need a count of the 'lol's). In the next cell, type:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">text1.count(&quot;whale&quot;)\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We see that \"whale\" occurs 906 times, but that seems a little low. Let's check on \"Whale\" and see how often that appears:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">text1.count(&quot;Whale&quot;)\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Whale\" with a capital \"W\" appears 282 times. This is a problem for us—we actually want them to be collapsed into one word, since \"whale\" and \"Whale\" really are the same for our purposes. We will deal with that in a moment. For the time being, we will accept that we have two entries for \"whale.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>This gets at a distinction between <strong>type</strong> and <strong>token</strong>. \"Whale\" and \"whale\" are different types (as of now) because they do not match identically. Every instance of \"whale\" in the corpus is another <strong>token</strong>—it is an instance of the type, \"whale.\" Therefore, there are 906 tokens of \"whale\" in our corpus.</p>\n",
      "<p>Let's fix this by making all of the words lowercase. We will make a new list of words, and call it text1_tokens. We will fill this list with all the words in text1, but in their lowercase form. Python has a built-in function, <code>lower()</code> that takes all letters and makes them lowercase. In this same step, we are going to do a kind of tricky move, and only keep the words that are alphabetical and pass over anything that is punctuation or numbers. There is a built-in function, <code>isalpha()</code>, that will allow us to save only those words that are made of letters. If <code>isalpha()</code> is true, we'll make the word lowercase, and keep the word. If not, we'll pass over it and move to the next one.</p>\n",
      "<p>Type the following code into a new cell in your notebook. Pay special attention to the indentation, which must appear as below.</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">text1_tokens = []\n",
      "for t in text1:\n",

      "<p><img alt=\"code\" src=\"images/for_loop_tokens.png\" /></p>\n",
      "<p>Another way to perform the same action more tersely is to use what's called a <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions\">list comprehension</a>. A list comprehension is a shorter, faster way to write a for-loop, but is syntactically a little more difficult to read (for a human). But, in this case, it's much faster to process:</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Great! Now <code>text1_tokens</code> is a list of all of the tokens in our corpus, with the punctuation removed, and all the words in lowercase.</p>\n",
      "<p>Now we want to know how many words there are in our corpus—that is, how many tokens in total. Therefore, we want to ask, \"What is the length of that list of words?\" Python has a built-in <code>len</code> function that allows you to find out the length of many types. Pass it a list, and it will tell you how many items are in the list. Pass it a string, and it will tell you how many characters are in the string. Pass it a dictionary, and it will tell you how many items are in the dictionary. In the next cell, type:</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>We see there are over 218,000 words in <em>Moby Dick</em> (including metadata). But this is the number of words total—we want to know the number of unique words. That is, we want to know how many <em>types</em>, not just how many tokens.</p>\n",
      "<p>In order to get unique words, rather than just all words in general, we will make a <strong>set</strong> from the list. A <code>set</code> in Python work just like it would <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)\">in math</a>, it's all the unique values, with any duplicate items removed.</p>\n",
      "<p>So let's find out the length of our set. just like in math, we can also nest our functions. So, rather than saying <code>x = set(text1_tokens)</code> and then finding the length of x, we can do it all in one step.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Great!

      "<p>If we want to use this metric to compare texts, we immediately notice a problem. Lexical density is dependent upon the length of a text and therefore is strictly a comparative measure. It is possible to compare 100 words from one text to 100 words from another, but because language is finite and repetitive, it is not possible to compare 100 words from one to 200 words from another. Even with these restrictions, lexical density is a useful metric in grade level estimations, <a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/2226-471X/2/3/7\">vocabulary use</a> and genre classification, and a reasonable proxy for lexical diversity.</p>\n",
      "<p>Let's take this constraint into account by working with only the first 10,000 words of our text. First we need to slice our list, returning the words in position 0 to position 9,999 (we'll actually write it as \"up to, but not including\" 10,000).</p>\n",

If that was all we had to do, we could stem the corpus and achieve the correct result, because stemming (as the name implies) really just means cutting off affixes to find the root (or the stem). Very quickly, however, this gets complicated, such as in the case of <code>men —&gt; man</code> and <code>sang —&gt; sing</code>. Lemmatization deals with this by looking up the word in a reference and finding the appropriate root (though note that this still is not entirely accurate). Lemmatization, therefore, takes a relatively long time, since each word must be looked up in a reference. NLTK comes with pre-built stemmers and lemmatizers.</p>\n",

The first step is to tokenize the words, transforming the giant string into a list of words. A simple way to do this would be to split on spaces, and that would probably be fine, but we are going to use the NLTK tokenizer to ensure that edge cases are captured (i.e., \"don't\" is made into 2 words: \"do\" and \"n't\").

      "<h1>Variables</h1>\n",
      "<p>A variable is <strong>a symbol that refers to an object</strong>, such as a string, integer, or list. If you're not already at the Python prompt, open your terminal and type <code>python</code> at the <code>$</code>. You're in the right place when you see <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>\n",
      "<p>Try these commands in order:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"pycon\">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 5\n",
      "&gt;&gt;&gt; x\n",
      "5\n",
      "&gt;&gt;&gt; x + 10\n",

      "'hello'\n",
      "&gt;&gt;&gt; y + &quot; and goodbye&quot;\n",
      "'hello and goodbye'\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As you can see above, the <code>=</code> sign lets you assign symbols like <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to data.</p>\n",
      "<p>Variables can be longer words as well:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"pycon\">&gt;&gt;&gt; breakfast = ['ham', 'eggs', 'toast']\n",
      "&gt;&gt;&gt; breakfast\n",
      "['ham', 'eggs', 'toast']\n",
      "&gt;&gt;&gt; type(breakfast)\n",
      "&lt;class 'list'&gt;\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Variables can have letters, numbers, and underscores, <strong>but should start with a letter</strong>.</p>\n",
      "<p>If you are curious about learning more about naming conventions for variables, you can check out the PEP8 style guide's section on <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions\">Naming Conventions</a>. PEP8 is the widely accepted guide for Python programmers everywhere.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Challenge</h2>\n",
      "<p>So I just told you that variables shouldn't start with a number or an underscore. What does that even mean? Will your computer explode if you write <code>3_flower = \"buttercup\"</code>?</p>\n",
      "<p>Only one way to find out. Try giving weird names to variables and see if you can learn a bit about the rules.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Running scripts</h1>\n",
      "<p>So far, you've interacted with Python one line at a time in the REPL. This is what we call the Interactive Mode, which is like a playground for experimenting and exploring different Python expressions,  like <code>2 + 2</code> or <code>type(\"some stuff\")</code>. The code that we write in the REPL is not saved after you exit, which means that this space is for running Python expressions and <em>not</em> for writing longer programs. </p>\n",
      "<p>For the rest of this session, we're going to expand beyond the REPL to write and execute longer programs. To do this, we will begin to work with text editor, where we write out longer Python scripts, and run those scripts from the terminal. </p>\n",
      "<p>This is a big move, so let's take it slow. The major change is that we will be working across two spaces, the terminal and the text editor, rather than just the terminal alone. We will be writing our scripts into the text editor, and using the terminal to run those scripts. </p>\n",
      "<h2>Your first script</h2>\n",
      "<p>First, let's begin with the text editor. Open your text editor of choice (such as VS Code) and create a new file with this line:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">print(&quot;Hello world!&quot;)\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Save it with the name <code>hello.py</code> to a known location, such as your desktop. Open your terminal and move to the desktop directory:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"console\">$ cd Desktop\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Once you're in the folder with your <code>hello.py</code> file, move to the terminal. Do <em>not</em> enter the Python Interactive Mode (the REPL), which is unecessary to run python scripts. Instead, lookout for the <code>$</code> symbol that lets you know you're in the terminal. If you find yourself in the Interactive mode (<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>), then exit it with <code>control-D</code>. You should see the <code>$</code> symbol, letting you know you're back in the terminal.  </p>\n",
      "<p>Now that you're in the terminal, type the following, and press enter:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"console\">$ python hello.py\n",
      "Hello world!\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>You should see the text <code>Hello world!</code> appear as output in the terminal window. </p>\n",
      "<p>There are a couple of important things to note here. First, it bears repeating that you are moving between two different spaces, the text editor and the terminal. You wrote your Python script in the text editor, and used the terminal to run the script. Second, within in the text editor, you included the <code>print()</code> function  because, unlike in the REPL, things aren't automatically printed out when writing scripts. When you're in the text editor, you always need to include the <code>print()</code> function so that your output will appear in the terminal. </p>\n",
      "<p>Congratulations! You've written your first script. That's kind of a big deal.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Challenges</h2>\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li>\n",
      "<p>Rewrite your program so that you assign the message to a variable, then print the variable. This will make your program two lines instead of one. There's a fancy programmer word for rewriting your code without changing it's behavior—\"refactoring.\"</p>\n",
      "</li>\n",
      "<li>\n",
      "<p>(optional) Are you already getting sick of typing <code>python hello.py</code> again and again? Try typing <code>!!</code> in the command line (the <code>$</code>). This will run your last line of code again.</p>\n",
      "</li>\n",
      "<li>\n",
      "<p>(even more optional) If you're on Windows and have a minute, try pressing the Windows button on your keyboard and searching for a program called <code>IDLE</code> that comes with Python. It's a special editor (or IDE) that lets you run Python code from inside it. You might like it more than git bash.</p>\n",
      "</li>\n",
      "</ol>\n",
      "<h2>A Note on Text</h2>\n",
      "<p>Fundamentally, Python programs are just text files. You can write them in any text editor, like VS Code or Notepad on Windows. When you pass the text file to Python, it runs the code in the file one line at a time. There's nothing special about <code>.py</code> files—they're just regular text files. This makes them work well with command line tools like Git. The tools you've learned so far—the command line, Git, markdown, grep—are all designed to work well together, and the medium through which they all work is plain text.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Errors in Python</h1>\n",
      "<p>Our usual response when seeing an error on a computer screen is a stress response. Our heart rate elevates and, if we cannot do what we were asking the computer to do, our frustration mounts. This is because many errors when interacting with programs are not useful or informative, and because we often have no capability to fix the program in front of us.</p>\n",
      "<p>In Python, errors are our friends. This might be hard to accept initially, but the errors you see when running Python scripts generally do a good job of pointing you to what's going wrong in your program. When you see an error in Python, therefore, try not to fall into the stress response you may be used to when interacting with your computer normally.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Two kinds of errors</h2>\n",
      "<p>In Python, there are two kinds of errors you will encounter frequently. One appears before the program runs, and the other appears during the execution of a program.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>syntax errors</strong> - When you ask Python to run a program or execute a line in the REPL, it will first check to see if the program is valid Python code—that is, that it follows the grammatical or syntactical rules of Python. If it doesn't, before the program even runs, you'll see a syntax error printed out to the screen.</p>\n",
      "<p>In this below example, the syntax error is a common one—mismatched single and double quotes, which is not allowed in Python. You can replicate the below error by opening the REPL (type <code>python</code> in the command line) and entering the line after the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt.</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"pycon\">&gt;&gt;&gt; print('This string has mismatched quotes. But Python will help us figure out this bug.&quot;)\n",
      "  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1\n",
      "    print('This string has mismatched quotes. But Python will help us figure out this bug.&quot;)\n",
      "                                                                                           ^\n",
      "SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Note the caret (<code>^</code>) underneath the mismatched quote, helpfully pointing out where the error lies. Similarly, if this error happened when running a script, Python would tell us the filename and the line number for the line on which the error occurs.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Traceback errors</strong> - These errors occur during the execution of a Python program when the program finds itself in an untenable state and must stop. Traceback errors are often logical inconsistencies in a program that is valid Python code. A common traceback error is referring to a variable that hasn't been defined, as below.</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"pycon\">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(not_a_variable)\n",
      "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
      "  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\n",
      "NameError: name 'not_a_variable' is not defined\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Traceback errors try to tell you a little about what happened in the program that caused the problem, including the category of error, such as <code>NameError</code> or <code>TypeError</code>.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Debugging</h2>\n",
      "<p>Debugging is a fancy word for fixing problems with a program. Here are some common strategies for debugging a program when first learning Python:</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>If the error is a syntax error, look at where the caret is pointing.</li>\n",
      "<li>If the error is a syntax error, pay attention to grammatical features such as quotes, parentheses, and indentation.</li>\n",
      "<li>If the error is a syntax error, consider reading the program, or the offending line, backward. It's surprising, but this often helps to detect the issue.</li>\n",
      "<li>If the error is a traceback error, first look at the line where the error occured, then consider the general category of error. What could have gone wrong?</li>\n",
      "<li>If the error is a name error (NameError), check your spelling.</li>\n",
      "<li>If the error is a traceback error, try copying the last line of the error and pasting it into Google. You'll often find a quick solution this way.</li>\n",
      "<li>If you changed the program and expect a different output, but are getting old output, you may not have saved the file. Go back and make sure the file has been correctly saved.</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<h2>Challenge</h2>\n",
      "<p>Try to create as many errors as you can in the next few minutes. After getting your first two syntax errors, try instead to get traceback errors. Some areas to try include mathematical impossibilities and using math operations on types that do not support them.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Lists and Loops</h1>\n",
      "<h2>Lists</h2>\n",
      "<p>Remember lists? They look like this:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">flowers = ['rose', 'violet', 'buttercup']\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For now, let's just create a list and print it out. In a text editor, our script will look like this:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">flowers = ['rose', 'violet', 'buttercup']\n",
      "print(flowers)\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Save this to a new file called <code>loop.py</code> and run it with <code>python loop.py</code>. You should see the list printed out in the terminal.</p>\n",
      "<p>So far, we've only learned one function: <code>type()</code>. Let's try out another:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">flowers = ['rose', 'violet', 'buttercup']\n",
      "# print(flowers)\n",
      "\n",
      "list_length = len(flowers)\n",
      "\n",
      "print(list_length)\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The <code>len()</code> function returns the number of items in a list or the number of characters in a string.</p>\n",
      "<p>Notice that, if you run the code above, you won't see the <code>flowers</code> list printed out. That's because that line has become a comment. If you put a <code>#</code> (hash or pound) at the beginning of a line, that line will be ignored.</p>\n",
      "<h2>List Indexing</h2>\n",
      "<p>A useful property of a list is the list index. This allows you to pick out an item from within the list by a number starting from zero:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">print(flowers[0]) # rose\n",
      "print(flowers[1]) # violet\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Note that the first item in the list is item [0]. The second item is item [1]. That's because counting in Python, and in almost all programming languages, starts from 0.</p>\n",
      "<p>You can print out the last item in a list using negative numbers:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">print(flowers[-1]) # buttercup\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>Loops</h2>\n",
      "<p>What if we want to print out each item in the list separately? For that, we'll need something called a loop:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">flowers = ['rose', 'violet', 'buttercup']\n",
      "# print(flowers)\n",
      "\n",
      "for flower in flowers:\n",
      "    print(&quot;My favorite flower is the &quot; + flower)\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>What's happening here? This kind of loop is called a \"for\" loop, and tells Python: \"for each item in the list, do something.\" Let's break it down:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code>for &lt;variable name&gt; in &lt;list name&gt;:\n",
      "    &lt;do something&gt;\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Indented code like this is known as a \"code block.\" Python will run the <code>&lt;do something&gt;</code> code in the code block once for each item in the list. You can also refer to <code>&lt;variable name&gt;</code> in the <code>&lt;do something&gt;</code> block.</p>\n",
      "<p>You can also perform more complicated operations. Let's tackle one in a challenge.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Challenge</h2>\n",
      "<p>Here's a list of numbers:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Write some code to print out the square of each of these numbers. Remember that the square of a number is that number times itself. The solution is <a href=\"solutions/loop.md\">here</a>, but you're not allowed to look at it until you've tried to solve it yourself for 3.5 minutes. (Seriously! That's 210 seconds.)</p>\n",
      "<h2>Advanced Challenge</h2>\n",
      "<p>First, ignore this challenge because it's too hard. Next, look up a new concept—\"string formatting\"—on Google and use it to write a loop that gives the following output:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"console\">The square of 2 is 4.\n",
      "The square of 3 is 9.\n",
      "The square of 5 is 25.\n",
      "The square of 7 is 49.\n",
      "The square of 11 is 121.\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The solution to this challenge is <a href=\"solutions/loop_adv.md\">here</a>. Take a look after you've tried to solve it yourself!</p>\n",
      "<h2>A Note on Variable Names</h2>\n",
      "<p>In this section, we've discussed flowers in the context of a list. But would a variable by any other name smell as sweet?</p>\n",
      "<p>Why do we use the variable name <code>flowers</code> in this section for our list of flower names? Why not just use the variable name <code>x</code>, or perhaps <code>f</code>?</p>\n",
      "<p>While the computer might not care if our list of flowers is called <code>x</code>, giving variables meaningful names makes a program considerably easier to read than it would be otherwise. Consider this for loop:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"python\">y = ['rose', 'violet', 'buttercup']\n",
      "\n",
      "for x in y:\n",
      "    print(x)\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Which is easier to read, this for loop or the one used in the example?</p>\n",
      "<p>When variable names accurately reflect what they represent, and are therefore meaningful, we call them \"semantic.\" Always try to create semantic variable names whenever possible.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Conditionals</h1>\n",
      "<p>Conditionals allow programs to change their behavior based on whether some statement is true or false. Let's try this out by writing a script that will give different outputs based on the weather:</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "if weather == &quot;sunny&quot;:\n",

      "    print(&quot;I don't know what you should bring! I'm just a little program...&quot;)\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In our first line, we set a variable <code>weather</code>  to the string \"sunny,\" representing what the weather is like outside. The <code>if</code> statement checks whether the variable weather is set to \"sunny.\" If it is, the code in the block beneath is executed, so the text \"Bring your shades\" will be printed.</p>\n",
      "<p>The <code>else</code> statement handles any inputs that aren't \"sunny\"—the program merely prints out that it doesn't know what you should bring. Try this script out both with the variable set to \"sunny\" and the variable set to some other value. </p>\n",
      "<p>What if we want our program to handle other kinds of weather, giving different messages for each one? Other cases after the first <code>if</code> statement are handled with <code>elif</code>:</p>\n",

When a function is inside an object, we usually call the function a \"method.\" When data is inside an object, we usually call it an \"attribute.\" The terminology isn't that important, though.

      "<h1>Introduction</h1>\n",
      "<p>Websites seem like these magical things that appear when we open our web browser (i.e. Chrome, Firefox, Safari). We know that websites are hypertext, meaning that we can click between links, travelling from page to page until we find what we need. What may be less obvious about websites is that, fundamentally <strong>websites are plain text documents</strong>, usually written in HTML or another web-based markup language, such as XML or XHTML.</p>\n",
      "<p><em>Fun fact</em>: <strong>Nearly 80% of all websites (whose markup language we know) use HTML.</strong>\n",
      "<a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ml-html/all/all\">(w3techs.com)</a></p>\n",
      "<h2>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h2>\n",
      "<p>HTML is a markup language used to write web-based documents. It enables us to provide web browsers with information about the <em>content</em> of a document. We can, for example, indicate that some part of our document is a paragraph, image, heading, or link. The browser uses this information when displaying the document for users.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Markup language vs. programming Language</h2>\n",
      "<p>HTML is a <em>markup</em> language, not a programming language. Programming languages are used to transform data, by creating scripts that organize an output of data based on a particular input of data. A markup language is used to control the presentation of data.</p>\n",
      "<p>For a practical example of this difference, we can think about tables. A programming language can help you search through a table, understand the kinds of data the table includes, find particular data points, or transform its content into other kinds of data, such as frequencies. A markup language would instead determine the content, layout, and visual presentation of the table.</p>\n",
      "<p>Fundamentally, then, a script or program is a set of instructions given to the computer. A document in a markup language determines how information is presented to a user.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>NOTE - Markup vs Markdown:</strong> Markdown and HTML are both types of markup languages; Markdown is a play on words. Markup languages help format content.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>\n",
      "<p>CSS is usually used in conjunction with HTML. HTML tells the browser what the different parts of a document <em>are</em>. CSS tells the browser what the parts of the document should <em>look like</em>. It is essentially a set of rules that are applied when rendering an HTML document. Its name—Cascading Style Sheets—refers to the fact that there is an order of precedence in how the browswer applies CSS rules to a document. More specific rules overwrite less specific rules.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Where does the internet come in?</h2>\n",
      "<p>Together, these languages can be used to write and style a website using a text editor (such as VS Code) directly from your computer. No internet access needed.</p>\n",
      "<p>However, internet access is necessary if you plan on making your website available to the public. At the end of this workshop, we will briefly discuss <a href=\"19-public.md\">how to get your website from your local computer onto the internet</a>.</p>\n",

      "<p>After the <code>DOCTYPE</code>, we see the start of the <strong>Root Element</strong>.

      "<p>The <strong>head section</strong> contains basic information about the file such as the title, keywords, authors, a short description, and so on.

You can use the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag to link to other documents or webpages you created for the same site or to documents located elsewhere on the web. You can also use it to link to a particular location on a page—we'll see an example of this in the section on classes and ids.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Option One: Relative Links</h2>\n",
      "<p>Relative links take the current page as an origin point and search for other files within the same folder or directory. This method is useful for creating links to pages within your own site.</p>\n",
      "<p>The following appears as a link to the <code>about.html</code> page in the same folder as <code>index.html</code>:</p>\n",

      "</blockquote>\n",
      "<p>This link is asking the browser to look for a file titled <code>about.html</code> in the same folder. If a file named <code>about.html</code> is not in the same folder, clicking the link will result in a <code>404</code> (\"Page Not Found\") error.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Option Two: Absolute Links</h2>\n",
      "<p>An absolute link includes information that allows the browser to find resources on other websites. This information includes the site domain—such as <code>google.com</code>—and often the protocol—such as <code>http</code> or <code>https</code>.</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"html\">&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;\n",

      "</blockquote>\n",
      "<p>This pathway is directing your browser to look online for this text document at the URL address provided.</p>\n",
      "<h2>More on links</h2>\n",
      "<p>Each example above includes an <code>href</code> tag. The <code>href</code> tag, short for hypertext reference, is an example of an <strong>attribute</strong>. Attributes offer secondary information about an element.</p>\n",
      "<p>The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, or anchor tag, creates a link. The text within the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code> tags, the anchor text, is what a visitor to the site will see and can click on. The <code>href=</code> attribute tells the browser where the user should be directed when they click the link.</p>\n",
      "<p>There is another technical difference between the two options above.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Relative vs. Absolute Links: When to use which</h2>\n",
      "<p>Use relative links when referring to pages on your own site. The main advantage of using relative links to pages on your site is that your site will not break if it is moved to a different folder or environment.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Activity</h2>\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li>Create a new text file called <code>about.html</code> in your <code>htmlpractice</code> folder. Copy over the HTML from your <code>index.html</code> file, but change the text in the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element to \"About.\"</li>\n",
      "<li>In your <code>index.html</code> file, add a relative link leading to your About page.</li>\n",
      "<li>Also add a relative link from your <code>About page</code> to your <code>index.html</code> page. In this link, call your <code>index.html</code> page <code>Home</code> (Reminder: <code>index.html</code> is the default homepage)</li>\n",
      "<li>Lastly, include an absolute link to a page of your choosing. Remember that an absolute link includes the protocol (for example, <code>http:</code>) and also a domain (for example, <code>cuny.edu</code>), such as <code>http://cuny.edu/about</code>.</li>\n",

      "</ol>\n",
      "<h2>Check if it worked</h2>\n",
      "<p>When your pages are updated, you should be able to navigate from your Home page to your About page, and vice versa. You should also be able to navigate to the external web page.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Images</h1>\n",
      "<p>Images are another important component of websites. Sometimes these just help bring your website to life, but other times they can help communicate information to users.</p>\n",
      "<p>Images are created with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. Similar to the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> requires an attribute, in this case <code>src</code>. The <code>src</code> attribute stands for \"source\" and communicates secondary information to your browser that identifies and locates the image. Unlike many other tags, the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag does not need to be closed, making it an example of a void tag.</p>\n",
      "<p>The following element pulls in an image located in the same folder as the <code>.html</code> file:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"html\">&lt;img src=&quot;scream.jpeg&quot; /&gt;\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The same rules apply here as with the <code>href</code> attribute: if the image is not located in the same folder as the document you are writing in, the browser won't find it. If the browser cannot find an image resource, you will see a broken image icon, such as this one from Chrome:</p>\n",
      "<p><img alt=\"Chrome broken image icon\" src=\"images/broken.png\" /></p>\n",
      "<p>Note: Some sites use a lot of images. When this is the case, it can be helpful to keep images in a separate folder within your site's structure. To enable the browser to find an image in that case, just add the directory in front of the file name. For example, if you have a folder named images in the same folder as your index.html file, and scream.jpeg is in that folder, you'd change the void tag above to <code>&lt;img src=\"/images/scream.jpeg\" /&gt;</code>.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Making images accessible</h2>\n",
      "<p>As briefly noted earlier, alternative text, or alt text, is descriptive \"text associated with an image that serves the same purpose and conveys the same essential information as the image\" (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Accessibility/Alternative_text_for_images\">Wikipedia Manual of Style/Accessibility/Alternative Text for Images</a> for more), and is important for ensuring content conveyed by images is accessible to all.</p>\n",
      "<p>To add alternative text to an image, you add an additional attribute, <code>alt</code> followed by your descriptive text. For example:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"html\">&lt;img src=&quot;filename.png&quot; alt=&quot;Text in these quotes describes the image&quot; /&gt;\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For more information, see what the <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/files/SSA_Alternative_Text_Guide.pdf\">Social Security Administration</a> has to say.</p>\n",
      "<h2>What images can I use on my site?</h2>\n",
      "<p>If you're planning to use images that you did not take or make yourself, you'll need to use \"public domain\" or \"open license\" images.</p>\n",
      "<p>This <a href=\"https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/blog/help/following-copyright-guidelines-for-images/\">guide by the OpenLab at City Tech</a> includes more information on licensure and a list of places where you can find reuseable images.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Activity</h2>\n",
      "<p>Download and save an image from the web, or move an image from your computer into the same folder as your <code>index.html</code> file.</p>\n",
      "<p>Tip: Give the file a simple name. Also, the name <strong>cannot</strong> have spaces. A good practice is to use either dashes or underscores where there would otherwise be spaces. For example: <code>this-is-an-image.jpg</code> or <code>this_is_an_image.jpg</code>.</p>\n",
      "<p>Using the code above as a reference, add that image into your <code>index.html</code> file, re-save the file, and re-open or refresh the page in your browser. Your image should now appear on the page.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Conventions</h1>\n",
      "<p>As we’ve gone through the different components of creating a webpage, you likely have noticed some common conventions or industry standards for creating a webpage using HTML. Can you guess any of these?</p>\n",
      "<p>Here are a few examples:</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>Some tags are self-closing, while others require a closing tag. Self-closing tags are called void tags, and are generally self-closing because you wouldn't need or want to add another element within a tag. They also generally end with a backslash (<code>/</code>) to mark the end of the tag.</li>\n",
      "<li>Use lower case. While HTML is not case sensitive, it makes scanning the code easier, and makes it look more consistent.</li>\n",
      "<li>Your code should be nested. This is not a technical necessity either — blank space has no meaning in html. However, this makes it easier to scan the code quickly, which is particularly helpful when you run into errors!</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<h1>Challenge: Create an Institute Website</h1>\n",
      "<p>For this challenge, practice using the command line. If you need a reminder of which commands to use to create new folders and files, see <a href=\"_cli-reminder.md\">here</a>.</p>\n",
      "<p>Using the tags we've just reviewed, and two additional ones (see below) begin creating an introductory page for your future Institute.</p>\n",
      "<p>In your <code>projects</code> folder on your desktop, create a new folder called <code>website</code>. Create a <code>index.html</code> file inside that folder. This will be the homepage or landing page of your site.</p>\n",
      "<p>Add HTML to your <code>index.html</code> file. This page should include the following:</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>Doctype</li>\n",
      "<li>Root element</li>\n",
      "<li>Head and a body</li>\n",

      "<li>One heading</li>\n",
      "<li>One paragraph</li>\n",
      "<li>One image</li>\n",
      "<li>A menu or navigation bar that links to your Home and About pages</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<p>Think about the order of your content as you assemble the body of your page.</p>\n",
      "<p>Don't worry about getting the content just right, as much as using this exercise to review the structure of a webpage, and practice creating a webpage.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Additional Tags</h2>\n",
      "<p>Here are two additional tags that might come in handy in assembling your page:</p>\n",
      "<p>To make a list, you open and close it with the <code>ul</code> tags, and each item is an enclosed <code>li</code> tag:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"html\">&lt;ul&gt;\n",
      "    &lt;li&gt; item 1 &lt;/li&gt;\n",
      "    &lt;li&gt; item 2 &lt;/li&gt;\n",

      "&lt;/ul&gt;\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The HTML above will produce an unordered (bulleted) list. To create an ordered (numbered) list instead, just substitute <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/ol&gt;</code> for <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code>.</p>\n",
      "<p>(This may come in handy when making your menu or navigation bar.)</p>\n",
      "<p>To make a line break or give space between different elements:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"html\">&lt;br /&gt;\n",

      "<h1>CSS Basics</h1>\n",
      "<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This language works in coordination with HTML, but is its own language with its own rules and terminology. In contrast to HTML, which is responsible for the content of the page, CSS is responsible for the presentation of the page.</p>\n",
      "<p>Examples of what CSS can help you determine include:</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>What background color you want to use for the page or a paragraph.</li>\n",
      "<li>What font or font size you want for your headings or your normal text.</li>\n",
      "<li>How large you want the images, and whether you want them aligned center, left, or right.</li>\n",
      "<li>Where elements appear on the page.</li>\n",
      "<li>Whether elements are visible to a user or not.</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<h1>Integrating CSS and HTML</h1>\n",
      "<p>In order for CSS to inform the style of the content on the page, it must be integrated with your HTML. CSS can be integrated into your HTML in three ways: inline, internal, and external.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Option one: inline</h2>\n",
      "<p>Inline styling adds CSS directly into the HTML of a page to adjust the style of particular parts of a page.</p>\n",

      "<ol>\n",
      "<li>It helps us remember what each language focuses on: HTML is for <em>content</em>, CSS is for <em>styling</em>. (This is sometimes referred to as <a href=\"https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/\">\"separation of concerns\"</a>)</li>\n",
      "<li>It helps us maintain consistency across the various pages of our site; multiple HTML files can link to the same CSS file.</li>\n",
      "<li>Because multiple HTML files can link to the same CSS file, it's not necessary to write the same CSS code multiple times. Once suffices.</li>\n",
      "</ol>\n",
      "<p>Option 3, external styling, is preferred by most web developers because it's more manageable and because it lends itself to greater consistency across the entire site.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Challenge</h2>\n",
      "<p>Create a stylesheet using the command line (following option 3, external styling, described above). In your <code>index.html</code> document, link to your style sheet and re-save the file.</p>\n",

      "<p>The lines within the curly braces (i.e. <code>{ }</code>) are called <strong>declarations</strong>, and they change the formatting of the elements in the HTML document. Each line in the declaration sets the value for a <strong>property</strong> and ends with a semicolon (<code>;</code>).</p>\n",
      "<p>Note the different syntax being used to select items for for styling with rule sets. The bottom two selectors are used to apply rule sets to <strong>ids</strong> and <strong>classes</strong>. In general, adding classes and ids to HTML elements allows for more specific styling — more on these soon!</p>\n",
      "<h2>Challenge</h2>\n",
      "<p>Copy and paste the CSS above into your <code>style.css</code> file and re-save the file. Then open or refresh your <code>index.html</code> file in your browser and see what happens.</p>\n",
      "<h2>What should happen?</h2>\n",
      "<p>The formatting of the text on your page should change accordingly. Your <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> should be orange and italic, for example.</p>\n",
      "<p>What are some other rules you might set for different HTML elements? Do a quick Google search for a CSS rule that changes the appearance of your page, such as putting a border around an element.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Filtering</h1>\n",
      "<p>Some of you may be wondering whether it matters what order you add the rule sets to your <code>style.css</code> document. The answer is no. CSS has an automatic filtering function where <strong>the most specific rule in CSS always takes precedence.</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>So if your stylesheet contained the following rule sets:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"css\">p {\n",
      "    color: green;\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "p strong {\n",
      "    color: red;\n",
      "}\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>...then the text of your paragraph would be green, but where the strong tag is found in the paragraph, the text would be bold and red. In other words, the more specific styling for the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> text in your paragraph will override the less specific styling of the paragraph in general. This would occur <strong>regardless of the order these rule sets appear in the stylesheet.</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>This rule also applies to how you integrate CSS into your HTML to style your content. For example, if you link to an external stylesheet, and you add inline or internal CSS into your HTML, the inline or internal CSS will override the rules set in the external stylesheet. Similarly, the inline CSS will override the internal CSS.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Classes and IDs</h1>\n",
      "<p>Classes and IDs enable more fine-grained styling by allowing you to define your own selectors. The difference between classes and IDs is that IDs are unique, used to identify one specific element or part of an element, whereas classes are used to identify multiple instances of the same type of element.</p>\n",
      "<p>Basically, if you're styling a part of your page that is unique, such as the navbar or footer, use an ID. If you're styling something that recurs in different places, like an info box or form field, use a class.</p>\n",
      "<p>Incorporating classes and IDs into the styling of your document includes two steps:</p>\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li>Some HTML code that CSS selectors can refer back to must be added to your HTML document.</li>\n",
      "<li>CSS rules that select that code must be added to your style sheet.</li>\n",
      "</ol>\n",
      "<p>The code for classes and IDs is different in both CSS and HTML.</p>\n",
      "<h2>HTML code</h2>\n",
      "<p>In HTML, classes and ids are added to the first part of a tag. Here's an example of what HTML code with classes and ids looks like:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"html\">&lt;ul id=&quot;navbar&quot;&gt;\n",
      "    &lt;li&gt;Home&lt;/li&gt;\n",
      "    &lt;li&gt;About&lt;/li&gt;\n",
      "&lt;/ul&gt;\n",
      "\n",

      "&lt;ul&gt;\n",
      "    &lt;li class=&quot;baseball american&quot; id=&quot;twins&quot;&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/li&gt;\n",
      "    &lt;li class=&quot;baseball american&quot; id=&quot;tigers&quot;&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/li&gt;\n",

      "    &lt;li class=&quot;baseball national&quot; id=&quot;dodgers&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;/li&gt;\n",
      "    &lt;li class=&quot;baseball national&quot; id=&quot;mets&quot;&gt;New York Mets&lt;/li&gt;\n",
      "&lt;/ul&gt;\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Note that it's possible to assign more than one class to an element — just leave a blank space between the two classes, as in the baseball examples above.</p>\n",
      "<p>Bonus: ID selectors can be used to create links that can be used for navigation <em>within</em> a page. For example, to add a link to the page that takes the user directly to the line that reads \"New York Mets,\" we might write HTML like this: <code>&lt;a href=\"#mets\"&gt;Mets&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>\n",
      "<h2>CSS selectors</h2>\n",
      "<p>Class selectors in CSS are denoted with a period in front of the class name you're creating. They look like this:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"css\">#navbar {\n",
      "  padding: 80px;\n",
      "  background-color: red;\n",
      "  color: white;\n",

      "</code></pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>ID selectors</h2>\n",
      "<p>...look like this in the CSS—the name of the selector preceeded by a hashmark (<code>#</code>) (also known as a pound sign or octothorpe):</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"css\">#navbar {\n",
      "    background-color: yellow;\n",

      "<p>Using the CSS basics we've just reviewed, and the list of properties found on the <a href=\"15-properties.md\">Properties page</a> and online, give your website some styling.</p>\n",
      "<p>I encourage you to use an external stylesheet with classes and IDs to style particular aspects of your site more specifically, but feel free to also play around with inline and internal styling if desired.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Challenge</h2>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>Change the color and size of your heading text.</li>\n",
      "<li>Change the font of your paragraph text.</li>\n",
      "<li>Change the background color of your navigation bar or menu.</li>\n",
      "<li>Center your image on your page.</li>\n",
      "<li><a href=\"_navbar-hint.md\">Shape up your navigation bar.</a></li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> After creating a stylesheet, you must link it to all HTML documents that you want this styling to apply to. You can do so with the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag:</p>\n",
      "<pre><code class=\"html\">&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; /&gt;\n",
      "</code></pre>\n",

      "<p>It is common—especially in the beginning—that you'll add or amend something to/in your text editor, but it won't present when rendered by your browser.</p>\n",
      "<p>Your first inclination should be to scan the text in your editor for errors. Nesting will help tremendously with this task. Oftentimes it is as little as forgetting a semicolon or closing tag.</p>\n",
      "<p>Another investigative tactic is to <strong>View Page Source</strong> on the page opened in the browser.</p>\n",
      "<p>If you think it is an <strong>error with the HTML</strong>, you'll be able to see it there.</p>\n",
      "<p>If you think it is an <strong>error with the CSS</strong>, then from the Page Source you'll need to click on the link for the <code>style.css</code> page. The link to this page should be found in the head of your page. Don't see it? That may be the problem! If you do see it, open the link to see what CSS the browser is reading and applying to your HTML. It should match what you have in your text editor. If it looks like an earlier version of your style sheet, then maybe you need to re-save the document.</p>\n",
      "<h1>Workshop Summary</h1>\n",
      "<p>Through this workshop, you have learned the basics of two of the most commonly-used languages for building on the web: HTML and CSS.</p>\n",
      "<p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, organizes content on your page using <a href=\"04-elements.md\">elements denoted by tags (<code>&lt; &gt;</code>)</a>. When rendered by your browser, these tags tell your browser that certain content is paragraph text, while other content is heading or title text, and so on. You can also use <a href=\"07-images.md\">image (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>)</a> and <a href=\"06-links.md\">link or anchor (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>)</a> tags to tell the browser to render an image on the page, or take the visitor to another page on your or another website. We also discussed some important <a href=\"08-conventions.md\">conventions</a> to consider when creating HTML documents, such as nesting.</p>\n",
      "<p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, allows for further styling of your website through the application of a series of <a href=\"12-rules.md\">rule sets</a> that are applied to different aspects/elements of your site. In order for CSS to render on a webpage, it must be <a href=\"11-integration.md\">integrated with your html</a>, which can happen in three ways: inline, internal, and external. CSS rules can be of varying specificity, and in particular, through creating <a href=\"14-classes.md\">classes and ids</a>. We also discussed how the ordering of rule sets doesn't matter, because an important function of CSS is the way it filters and applies rules in accordance with the specificity of the rule.</p>\n",
      "<p>Through understanding these languages in combination with one another, you can also reframe your understanding of the web—not as <em>poof! magic!</em>, but as a series of intentionally styled, hyperlinked text documents, with each website representing a folder of documents.</p>\n",
      "<p>While this is a good starting point, one important question remains: how can I get these text documents on the Internet so they can be accessed, and interacted with, and linked to by others?</p>\n",
      "<h1>Making your Website Public</h1>\n",
      "<p>Great job! Now you have an amazing website, but it's stuck on your computer where no one else can find it or view it. How do you get your website onto the Internet so it can be shared?</p>\n",
      "<p>To get your site on the internet, you'll need <strong>hosting</strong> — that is, a remote computer that will stay on day in and day out to serve the website to visitors. In theory, you could host your website on your own computer, but in practice, it usually makes sense to purchase hosting from a hosting company or use a free service.</p>\n",
      "<p>You'll also need a way of getting your website to your host. That's where FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, comes in.</p>\n",
      "<h2>FTP</h2>\n",
      "<p>FTP is a protocol used to share files from your computer (<em>a client</em>) to another computer called a server, and back again over the Internet. This is something we do ALL THE TIME, but we refer to it as \"uploading\" and \"downloading.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Note: Though FTP stands for file transfer protocol, you are not really transfering or moving your files from your computer; instead they are <em>copied</em> to the server. Fear not!</p>\n",
      "<p>In order to transfer your website files (also called your website's directory) to a server you will need:</p>\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li>Access to the Internet.</li>\n",
      "<li>An FTP Client.</li>\n",
      "<li>A server that is connected to the Internet where you can send your files.</li>\n",
      "</ol>\n",
      "<p>Assuming you all can manage accessing the internet on your own, let's focus on the latter two.</p>\n",
      "<h3>FTP client</h3>\n",
      "<p>An <strong>FTP client</strong> is software designed specifically for the purpose of sharing files between computers. There are widely-used, freely-available GUI applications (i.e., applications that use a graphic user interface, or the point-and-click, user-friendly software interfaces you are used to) that you can download for use, including <a href=\"https://filezilla-project.org/\">Filezilla</a> and <a href=\"https://cyberduck.io/\">Cyberduck</a>. You can also run an FTP client program through the command line on most computers, though the process varies by operating system.</p>\n",

The first step in that analysis is to transform texts designed for human consumption into a form a computer can analyze. Using Python and the Natural Language ToolKit (commonly called NLTK), this workshop introduces strategies to turn qualitative texts into quantitative objects. Through that process, we will present a variety of strategies for simple analysis of text-based data.</p>\\n<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>\\n<p>In this workshop, you will learn the following skills:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Identify strategies for transforming texts into numbers</li>\\n<li>Explain what a concordance is, how to find one, and why it matters</li>\\n<li>Compare frequency distribution of words in a text to quantify the narrative arc</li>\\n<li>Explain what stop words are and why they are often removed</li>\\n<li>Remove stop words in a variety of languages</li>\\n<li>Utilize Part-of-Speech tagging to gather insights about a text</li>\\n<li>Transform any document that you have (or have access to) in a .txt format into a text that can be analyzed computationally</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Estimated time</h2>\\n<p>10 hours</p>\\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Intro to Python workshop</li>\\n<li>Basic knowledge on Jupyter Notebook</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Contexts</h2>\\n<h3>Pre-reading suggestions</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-tutorial-to-jupyter-notebooks-1b2f8705888a\">A Beginner’s Tutorial to Jupyter Notebooks</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/textual-analysis/\">What is text analysis</a> <!--- I don\\'t love this one, but haven\\'t found a better one yet --></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Projects that use these skills</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"https://libguides.bc.edu/textdatamining/projects\">Short list of academic Text &amp; Data mining projects</a> </li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/parulnith/Building-a-Simple-Chatbot-in-Python-using-NLTK\">Building a Simple Chatbot from Scratch in Python</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TGDivy/MBTI-Personality-Classifier\">Classifying personality type by social media posts</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>In working with massive amounts of text, it is natural to lose the original context. We must be aware of that and be careful when analizing it.</li>\\n<li>It is important to constantly question our assumptions and the indexes we are using. Numbers and graphs do not tell the story, our analysis does. We must be careful not to draw hasty and simplistic conclusions for things that are complex. Just because we found out that author A uses more unique words than author B, does it mean that A is a better writer than B?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Resources (optional)</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/python.md\">Installing Anaconda</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/nltk.md\">Installing NLTK</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"http://maxmelnick.com/2016/04/19/python-beginner-tips-and-tricks.html\">Jupyter Notebook shortcuts, tips and tricks</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/michellejm\">Michelle McSweeney</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rachelrakov\">Rachel Rakov</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rafadavis\">Rafael Davis Portela</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kallewesterling\">Kalle Westerling</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/smythp\">Patrick Smyth</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/story645\">Hannah Aizenman</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lmrhody\">Lisa Rhody</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kchatlosh\">Kelsey Chatlosh</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gofilipa\">Filipa Calado</a></li>\\n</ul>'"
